Germline GATA2 deficiency is associated with a susceptibility to IFD. To determine whether myeloid gene mutations were associated with IFD risk  we identified 2 complementary cohorts of patients with myeloid malignancy  based on (1) the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA)  or (2) the presence of GATA2 mutations identified during standard clinical sequencing. We found somatic GATA2 mutations in 5 of 27 consecutive patients who had myeloid malignancy and developed IA. Among 51 consecutive patients with GATA2 mutations identified in the evaluation of myeloid malignancy  we found that IFD was diagnosed and treated in 21 (41%)  all of whom had received chemotherapy or had undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Pulmonary infections and disseminated candidiasis were most common. The 90-day mortality was 52% among patients with IFD. Our results indicate that patients with somatic GATA2 mutations are a vulnerable subgroup of patients with myeloid malignancy who have high risk for treatment-associated IFD and suggest that a focused approach to antifungal prophylaxis be considered."
"2","Strategies for the Prevention of Invasive Fungal Infections after Lung Transplant.","Bitterman, R","33562370",2021,"10.3390/jof7020122","J Fungi (Basel)","eng","Switzerland","Long-term survival after lung transplantation is lower than that associated with other transplanted organs. Infectious complications  most importantly invasive fungal infections  have detrimental effects and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. Candida infections predominate in the early post-transplant period  whereas invasive mold infections  usually those related to Aspergillus  are most common later on. This review summarizes the epidemiology and risk factors for invasive fungal diseases in lung transplant recipients  as well as the current evidence on preventive measures. These measures include universal prophylaxis  targeted prophylaxis  and preemptive treatment. Although there is consensus that a preventive strategy should be implemented  current data show no superiority of one preventive measure over another. Data are also lacking regarding the optimal antifungal regimen and the duration of treatment. As all current recommendations are based on observational  single-center  single-arm studies  it is necessary that this longstanding debate is settled with a multicenter randomized controlled trial."

In light of increasing incidence and mortality of influenza associated aspergillosis  our study summarized risk factors  clinical characteristics  and prognostic factors of developing aspergillosis in immunocompetent hosts with influenza to further screen high-risk population and improve outcome. Methods: We reviewed the patient characteristics  laboratory examinations  radiological imaging  and microbiology data of 72 influenza patients with IPA and 84 influenza patients without IPA admitted to West China Hospital. Result: Our study shown that aspergillosis co-infection increased overall mortality of severe influenza from 22.6 to 52.8%  along with higher white blood count (WBC) (10.9 ± 5.0 vs. 8.4 ± 3.3  P = 0.016)  Neutrophiles (9.5 ± 5.0 vs. 7.0 ± 3.8  P = 0.023)  procalcitonin (PCT) (8.6 ± 15.9 vs. 1.2 ± 2.1  P = 0.009)  and a lower CD4+ T cell count (189.2 ± 135.3 vs. 367.1 ± 280.0  P = 0.022) in death group. No impact of age  gender  underlying diseases  immunosuppressive agents and steroids use  CD4+ T cell count on incidence of influenza associated aspergillosis was observed. But influenza associated aspergillosis cases mostly accompanied with more H1N1 subtype (91.7 vs. 79.8%  P = 0.037) and higher level of C-reactive protein (CRP) (117.6 ± 88.1 vs. 78.5 ± 75.2  P = 0.017) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) (133.5 ± 149.2 vs. 69.9 ± 100.0  P = 0.021) than those without aspergillosis. Conclusion: Aspergillosis co-infection in severe influenza patients can lead to a significant increased mortality  which was associated with severe respiratory failure due to mixed infection and immunosuppression. Pulmonary excessive inflammatory response was related with IPA co-infection."

Most of them were male (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>104; 72%)  were overweight (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>99; 68%)  and had hypertension (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>83; 57%) and diabetes (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>46; 32%). Few patients presented preexisting host risk factors for invasive fungal infection (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>20; 14%). Their global severity was high; all patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation  and half (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>73  54%) were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Mycological analysis included 2 815 mycological tests (culture  galactomannan  ß-glucan  and PCR) performed on 475 respiratory samples and 532 sera. A probable/putative invasive pulmonary mold infection was diagnosed in 7 (4.8%) patients and linked to high mortality. Multivariate analysis indicates a significantly higher risk for solid organ transplant recipients (odds ratio  <U+2009>=<U+2009>4.66; interquartile range  1.98-7.34; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.004). False-positive fungal test and clinically irrelevant colonization  which did not require the initiation of antifungal treatment  was observed in 25 patients (17.2%).Conclusions: In patients with no underlying immunosuppression  severe SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia seems at low risk of invasive fungal secondary infection  especially aspergillosis."

SFTS virus induces immunosuppression  mediated by interleukin-10 production  reduction of CD3+ and CD4+ T cells  and cytokine storms  and this may lead to various complications in critical SFTS patients. Recently  there have been reports of cases of invasive pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) in patients with SFTS in the absence of predisposing factors of IPA. However  there is no known relationship between SFTS and mycosis. Here  we report a SFTS patient with a low CD4+ T-cell count and a high viral load  who developed possible IPA in the absence of common risk factors for mycosis. This case adds to the evidence that IPA may occur as a complication of SFTS."

Risk factors that lead to IPA include immunosuppression through corticosteroid use. IPA complicated by hydropneumothorax is rare and its mechanism of formation is unknown. CASE REPORT A 72-year-old woman recently diagnosed with a right frontal meningioma that was managed with dexamethasone presented with a new 3-day history of nonproductive cough  chest pain  and dyspnea and was managed for pneumonia. The patient failed to improve  prompting a follow-up computed tomography scan  which revealed a right middle lobe cavitary lesion. During the workup of this lesion  the patient's hospital course was complicated by hemoptysis and development of a large right hydropneumothorax that was successfully managed with a chest tube. Despite initial resolution of hydropneumothorax  the patient developed a right apical pneumothorax that gradually worsened. Bronchoscopy culture revealed Aspergillus fumigatus  leading to the diagnosis of IPA  which was managed with intravenous voriconazole. CONCLUSIONS Corticosteroid use with subsequent immunosuppression is a risk factor for developing IPA. Clinicians should include IPA in their differential diagnosis for respiratory infections in patients receiving corticosteroids. Although overall prognosis of IPA is poor  outcomes can be improved with early diagnosis  early empiric initiation of antifungals  and withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy. IPA complicated by hydropneumothorax is a rare phenomenon with a poorly understood mechanism of formation. Based on our case  we propose a mechanism of hydropneumothorax formation from IPA."

The syndromes of pulmonary aspergillosis complicating severe viral infections are distinct from classic invasive aspergillosis  which is recognized most frequently in persons with neutropenia and in other immunocompromised persons. Combined with severe viral infection  aspergillosis comprises a constellation of airway-invasive and angio-invasive disease and results in risks associated with poor airway fungus clearance and killing  including virus- or inflammation-associated epithelial damage  systemic immunosuppression  and underlying lung disease. Radiologic abnormalities can vary  reflecting different pathologies.

This literature review aims to explore and describe the updated information about COVID-19 associated with pulmonary aspergillosis. We found that Aspergillus spp. can cause co-infections in patients with COVID-19  especially in severe/critical illness. The incidence of IPA in COVID-19 ranged from 19.6% to 33.3%. Acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation was the common complications  and the overall mortality was high  which could be up to 64.7% (n = 22) in the pooled analysis of 34 reported cases. The conventional risk factors of invasive aspergillosis were not common among these specific populations. Fungus culture and galactomannan test  especially from respiratory specimens could help early diagnosis. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common species causing co-infection in COVID-19 patients  followed by Aspergillus flavus. Although voriconazole is the recommended anti-Aspergillus agent and also the most commonly used antifungal agent  aspergillosis caused by azole-resistant Aspergillus is also possible. Additionally  voriconazole should be used carefully in the concern of complicated drug-drug interaction and enhancing cardiovascular toxicity on anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Finally  this review suggests that clinicians should keep alerting the possible occurrence of pulmonary aspergillosis in severe/critical COVID-19 patients  and aggressively microbiologic study in addition to SARS-CoV-2 via respiratory specimens should be indicated."

At present  voriconazole is the first-line treatment for invasive fungal disease. The pharmacokinetic interindividual variability of voriconazole depends on genetic factors. CYP450 is involved in 70%-75% of total metabolism of voriconazole  mainly CYP3A4 and CYP2C19  with the remaining 25%-30% of metabolism conducted by monooxygenase flavins. CYP2C19 single nucleotide polymorphisms could explain 50%-55% of variability in voriconazole metabolism.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"":The main objective is to compare efficiency of pre-emptive voriconazole genotyping with routine practice. The primary outcome is serum voriconazole on the fifth day within the therapeutic range. The secondary outcome is the combined variables of therapeutic failure and adverse events within 90<U+2009>days of first administration  associated with voriconazole. A total of 146 patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis who will potentially receive voriconazole will be recruited  and CYP2C19 will be genotyped. If the patient ultimately receives voriconazole  they will be randomised (1:1 experimental/control). In the experimental arm  patients will receive a dose according to a pharmacogenetic algorithm  including CYP2C19 genotype and clinical and demographic information. In the control arm  patients will receive a dose according to clinical practice guidelines. In addition  a Spanish National Healthcare System (NHS) point-of-view cost-effectiveness evaluation will be performed. Direct cost calculations for each arm will be performed.

The presence of specific host genetic variants and the patient's immune system status may also influence the establishment of an IMI and the outcome of its therapy. Immunological components can thus be expected to play a pivotal role not only in the risk assessment and diagnosis  but also in the treatment of IMI. Cytokines could improve the reliability of an invasive aspergillosis diagnosis by serving as biomarkers as do serological and molecular assays  since they can be easily measured  and the turnaround time is short. The use of immunological markers in the assessment of treatment response could be helpful to reduce overtreatment in high risk patients and allow prompt escalation of antifungal treatment. Mould-active prophylaxis could be better targeted to individual host needs  leading to a targeted prophylaxis in patients with known immunological profiles associated with high susceptibility for IMI  in particular invasive aspergillosis. The alteration of cellular antifungal immune response through oncological drugs and immunosuppressants heavily influences the outcome and may be even more important than the choice of the antifungal treatment.

ITS sequencing was unable to distinguish A. lentulus from A. fumigatus  but sequencing of the benA  CaM  and rod A loci enabled reliable distinction of these closely related species. Phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that the ITS region had little variation within the Aspergillus section Fumigati while the benA gene offered the highest intraspecific discrimination. Microsatellite typing results revealed that only loci on chromosomes 1  3  5  and 6b generated detectable amplicons for identification. All A. lentulus isolates showed in vitro resistance to multiple antifungal drugs including amphotericin B (MIC range 4 to 8 µg/ml)  itraconazole (MIC 2 µg/ml)  voriconazole (MIC of 4-16 µg/ml)  and posaconazole (MIC of 0.5-1 µg/ml). However  MECs for the echinocandin drugs ranged from 0.03-0.25  =0.008-0.015  and =0.015-0.03 µg/ml for caspofungin  micafungin  and anidulafungin  respectively. A. lentulus is an emerging fungal pathogen in China  causing fatal disease  and clinicians as well as laboratories should be alert to their increasing presence."

All patients were treated with voriconazole therapy  and three of these patients underwent surgery. All but one patient survived at the last follow-up (median duration was 14 months (IQR- 8-21.5). Two patients had complete resolution  and voriconazole was stopped at the last follow-up  and the rest of the patients were continued on voriconazole. Of the six patients who were continued on voriconazole  all but one had more than 50% radiological resolution on follow-up imaging.

Aspergillosis  candidiasis  fusariosis  mucormycosis  cryptococcosis and trichosporonosis are the most important infections reported in patients with hematologic malignancies that undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These infections are caused by opportunistic fungal pathogens that do not cause severe issues in healthy individuals  but in patients with hematologic malignancies lead to disseminated infection with different clinical manifestations. Prophylaxis and creating a safe environment with proper filters and air pressure for patients to avoid contact with the pathogens in the surrounding environment can prevent IFI. Furthermore  due to the absence of specific symptoms in IFI  rapid and accurate diagnosis reduces the mortality rate of these infections and using molecular techniques along with standard mycological methods will improve the diagnosis of disseminated fungal infection in patients with hematologic disorders. Amphotericin B products  extended-spectrum azoles  and echinocandins are the essential drugs to control invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies  and according to various conditions of patients  different results of treatment with these drugs have been reported in different studies. On the other hand  drug resistance in recent years has led to therapeutic failures and deaths in patients with blood malignancies  which indicates the need for antifungal susceptibility tests to use appropriate therapies. Life-threatening fungal infections have become more prevalent in patients with hematologic malignancies in recent years due to the emergence of new risk factors  new species  and increased drug resistance. Therefore  in this review  we discuss the different dimensions of the most critical invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies and present a list of these infections with different clinical manifestations  treatment  and outcomes."

Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is an infection with a locally invasive presentation  reported especially in patients with chronic pulmonary disease  while aspergilloma is typically found in patients with previously formed cavities in the lungs. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is due to a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus antigens and is more frequently described in patients with moderate-severe asthma or cystic fibrosis. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis mainly occurs in patients with neutropenia or immunodeficiency  but has increasingly been recognized as an emerging disease of non-neutropenic patients. The significance of this infection has dramatically increased in recent years  considering the high number of patients with an impaired immune state associated with the management and treatment of neoplasm  solid or hematological transplantation  autoimmune diseases  and inflammatory conditions. Moreover  prolonged steroid treatment is recognized as an important risk factor  especially for invasive disease. In this setting  critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units and/or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease could be at higher risk for invasive infection. This review provides an update on the clinical features and risk factors of pulmonary aspergillosis. Current approaches for the diagnosis  management  and treatment of these different forms of pulmonary aspergillosis are discussed."

Patients with IAA had significantly longer durations of antibiotic therapy  vasoactive support and mechanical ventilation. Aspergillus was the most common respiratory co-pathogen (9/40  22%) followed by classical bacterial co-pathogens. IAA was not associated with classical risk factors. Aspergillus is a common superinfection in critically ill influenza patients associated with poor outcome and longer duration of organ supportive therapies.

Life-threatening fungal infections mainly occur in immunocompromised patients  and are typically caused by environmental opportunists that take advantage of a weakened immune system. The filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is the most important and well-documented mold pathogen of humans  causing a number of complex respiratory diseases  including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis  an often fatal disease in patients with acute leukemia or in immunosuppressed bone marrow or solid organ transplant recipients. However  non-Aspergillus molds are increasingly reported as agents of disseminated diseases  with Fusarium  Scedosporium  Lomentospora and mucormycete species now firmly established as pathogens of immunosuppressed and immunocompetent individuals. Despite well-documented risk factors for invasive fungal diseases  and increased awareness of the risk factors for life-threatening infections  the number of deaths attributable to molds is likely to be severely underestimated driven  to a large extent  by the lack of readily accessible  cheap  and accurate tests that allow detection and differentiation of infecting species. Early diagnosis is critical to patient survival but  unlike Aspergillus diseases  where a number of CE-marked or FDA-approved biomarker tests are now available for clinical diagnosis  similar tests for fusariosis  scedosporiosis and mucormycosis remain experimental  with detection reliant on insensitive and slow culture of pathogens from invasive bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  tissue biopsy  or from blood.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis results from airway hypersensitivity from aspergillus colonization almost exclusively in patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis typically presents in immunocompetent patients with underlying lung pathology. Treatment is primarily with antifungal agents; however  other measures such as surgical resection may be necessary. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a severe infection in immunocompromised patients and is characterized by invasion of pulmonary vasculature by the Aspergillus hyphae. Recent advances in the diagnosis and management of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis include emerging risk factors such as critically ill patients  and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and liver disease. In addition  noninvasive biomarkers have made it easier to suspect and diagnose invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. There are more effective and better-tolerated antifungal agents that have improved patient outcomes. This review introduces the spectrum of pulmonary aspergillosis geared toward generalists  including disease manifestations  most recent diagnostic criteria  and first-line treatment options.

The fungus grows on decaying food  soil  and animal excrement. Patients usually become infected by inhalation of spores. The most common risk factors include diabetes mellitus  hematologic malignancy  and solid organ or stem cell transplant. PM can have a nonspecific appearance at imaging. For example  early imaging may show peribronchial ground-glass opacity. Later  the disease progresses to consolidation  nodules  or masses. Because patients are usually immunocompromised  the differential diagnosis often includes invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Various radiologic findings suggestive of PM have been identified to help differentiate it from IPA. For example  the reverse halo sign is more closely associated with PM than with IPA. The reverse halo sign is an area of ground-glass opacity surrounded by a rim of consolidation. In addition  the presence of pleural effusions and more than 10 nodules is more suggestive of PM than it is of IPA. PM can progress rapidly in neutropenic patients. Identification of the hyphae in tissue by using endobronchial or percutaneous sampling can allow differentiation from IPA and help confirm the diagnosis of mucormycosis. Because of the high mortality rate associated with PM  early identification of the disease is critical for an improved likelihood of survival. A multimodality treatment approach with antifungal agents and surgical débridement has been shown to improve outcomes.

We queried the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) for risk factors for IFI in these patients.                 Label=""METHODS"":Patients who underwent a kidney transplant between 2005 and 2008 were queried for an IFI diagnosis using ICD-9 codes. An IFI was defined as at least one documented diagnosis from one of the following: (1) Candida (candidemia); (2) Histoplasmosis; (3) Aspergillosis; (4) Cryptococcosis; (5) &quot;Other&quot; mycoses. Potential risk factors included demographics  certain comorbidities and immunosuppressive medications. To examine the relative risk (RR)  simple bivariate models were used  followed by a comprehensive full model to estimate the adjusted RR (aRR).                 Label=""RESULTS"":Of 57 188 kidney transplant patients  1 218 had 1 343 IFI diagnoses  with a median time to infection of 495 days. &quot;Other&quot; mycoses accounted for the most IFI diagnoses (37%)  followed by aspergillosis (22%). The risk for any IFI was increased with age =65 years. Diabetes (aRR<U+202F>=<U+202F>1.71)  bacterial pneumonia (aRR<U+202F>=<U+202F>1.62) and UTI (aRR<U+202F>=<U+202F>1.34) were the top 3 clinical risk factors for infection. Each of the IFI groups was also associated with individual risk factors. Therapy with mycophenolate mofetil was associated with a decreased risk of candidemia.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"":Risk factors for IFI in renal transplant patients include demographic  medication-associated and clinical data  as well as organism-specific factors. These results offer an extensive clinical profile of risk for IFI  and may thus help inform the diagnosis and presumptive therapy of invasive fungal infections in renal transplant recipients. "

Despite well known risk factors and different available assays  diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis remains challenging. 103 clinical variables from patients with hematological malignancies and subsequent alloSCT were collected. Associations between collected variables and patients with (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>36) and without IA (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>36) were investigated by applying univariate and multivariable logistic regression. The predictive power of the final model was tested in an independent patient cohort (23 IA cases and 25 control patients). Findings were investigated further by in vitro studies  which analysed the effect of etanercept on A. fumigatus-stimulated macrophages at the gene expression and cytokine secretion. Additionally  the release of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) in patient sera was studied. Low monocyte concentration (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-06)  severe GvHD of the gut (grade 2-4) (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.08<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-02) and etanercept treatment of GvHD (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-03) were significantly associated with IA. Our studies showed that etanercept lowers CXCL10 concentrations in vitro and ex vivo and down-regulates genes involved in immune responses and TNF-alpha signaling. Our study offers clinicians new information regarding risk factors for IA including low monocyte counts and administration of etanercept. After necessary validation  such information may be used for decision making regarding antifungal prophylaxis or closely monitoring patients at risk."

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of invasive fungal infections and their predisposing factors in a singlecenter cohort of patients who received liver transplant.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"":For this study  250 adult patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant between March 2010 and March 2015 were enrolled. All patients were followed prospectively for infections.                 Label=""RESULTS"":The diagnosis of invasive fungal infection was made in 15 patients (6%). One patient had 2 episodes of fungal infection  and reoperation was performed for 3 patients. Invasive aspergillosis developed in 8 patients (53.3%) followed by Candida species infection in 3 patients (20%) and cryptococcosis in 2 patients (13.3%).The main predisposing factors were renal failure (12/15) and positive history of rejection (11/15). Other risk factors for development of invasive fungal infections were choledochojejunostomy in 3 patients (20%)  bile leaks in 3 patients (20%)  and pretransplant steroid use in 2 patients (11.8%). Two patients (13.3%) died due to invasive fungal infections.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"":In this single-center series of liver transplant recipients  the incidence of invasive fungal infections was relatively low  probably due to the universal prophylaxis with fluconazole and limited use of the broad-spectrum antibiotics. Early diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections could lead to a better prognosis for liver transplant recipients with invasive fungal infections. "

These infections account for 5% of all infections in renal transplant recipients. The symptoms of systemic fungal infections are nonspecific  particularly in their early stages  and this can lead to delay in diagnosis. Retrospective analysis was conducted on all renal transplants that were performed at our center over a 20-year period from 1996-2016. Cases of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) that occurred among renal transplant recipients were identified to describe the epidmeiology of these infections. A total of 67 (9.2%) IFI cases were identified among 725 renal transplant recipients. Of the 67 patients (9.24%) with IFI  31 (46.2%) cases were seen in deceased donor transplant recipients. Of 67 cases with IFI  42 (62.7%) had received induction therapy. The incidence of fungal infections according to the induction agent used was  14.3% with basiliximab  12.3% each with daclizumab and rabbit antithymocyte globulin  and 6.3% among patients not given any induction. Invasive candidiasis was the most common IFI overall  followed by mucormycosis  invasive aspergillosis  and cryptococcosis. Median time to onset of IFI was 117.9 days. Majority of infections occurred within 180 days after transplantation. Late posttransplant (&gt;180 days after transplantation) IFI's were predominantly caused by Candida  followed by Cryptococcus. The longest time to infection was a case of histoplasma  occurring seven years posttransplant. The overall 12-month cumulative incidence (CI) for any IFI was 9.1%. The 12-month CI of the first IFI increased from 7.3% between 1996 and 2001 to 10.5% between 2010 and 2016. The overall mortality rate was 38.8%. The use of newer and more-effective immunosuppressive agents in recent years are associated with increased rates of fungal infections in renal transplant recipients. Therefore  early detection of fungal infections and proper therapy are important in improving survival and reducing mortality."

New therapies for malignant and autoimmune diseases have led to new risk factors for unusual mycoses. Invasive candidiasis is increasingly caused by non-albicans Candida spp.  including C. auris  a multidrug-resistant yeast with the potential for nosocomial transmission that has rapidly spread globally. The use of mould-active antifungal prophylaxis in patients with cancer or transplantation has decreased the incidence of invasive fungal disease  but shifted the balance of mould disease in these patients to those from non-fumigatus Aspergillus species  Mucorales  and Scedosporium/Lomentospora spp. The agricultural application of triazole pesticides has driven an emergence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus in environmental and clinical isolates. The widespread use of topical antifungals with corticosteroids in India has resulted in Trichophyton mentagrophytes causing recalcitrant dermatophytosis. New dimorphic fungal pathogens have emerged  including Emergomyces  which cause disseminated mycoses globally  primarily in HIV infected patients  and Blastomyceshelicus and B. percursus  causes of atypical blastomycosis in western parts of North America and in Africa  respectively. In North America  regions of geographic risk for coccidioidomycosis  histoplasmosis  and blastomycosis have expanded  possibly related to climate change. In Brazil  zoonotic sporotrichosis caused by Sporothrix brasiliensis has emerged as an important disease of felines and people."

This position paper establishes broadly applicable definitions of breakthrough IFI for clinical research. Representatives of the Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (MSG-ERC) and the European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) reviewed the relevant English literature for definitions applied and published through 2018. A draft proposal for definitions was developed and circulated to all members of the two organisations for comment and suggestions. The authors addressed comments received and circulated the updated document for approval. Breakthrough IFI was defined as any IFI occurring during exposure to an antifungal drug  including fungi outside the spectrum of activity of an antifungal. The time of breakthrough IFI was defined as the first attributable clinical sign or symptom  mycological finding or radiological feature. The period defining breakthrough IFI depends on pharmacokinetic properties and extends at least until one dosing interval after drug discontinuation. Persistent IFI describes IFI that is unchanged/stable since treatment initiation with ongoing need for antifungal therapy. It is distinct from refractory IFI  defined as progression of disease and therefore similar to non-response to treatment. Relapsed IFI occurs after treatment and is caused by the same pathogen at the same site  although dissemination can occur. These proposed definitions are intended to support the design of future clinical trials and epidemiological research in clinical mycology  with the ultimate goal of increasing the comparability of clinical trial results."

Inhalation of Aspergillus spores is the main transmission route of IA in immunocompromised patients. Construction work in hospitals is a risk factor for environmental fungal contamination. We measured airborne fungal contamination and the incidence of IA among immunocompromised patients  and evaluated their correlation with different types of construction works.                 Label=""Methods"":Our tertiary hospital in Seoul  Korea underwent facility construction from September 2017 to February 2018. We divided the entire construction period into period 1 (heavier works: demolition and excavation) and period 2 (lighter works: framing  interior designing  plumbing  and finishing). We conducted monthly air sampling for environmental spore surveillance in three hematologic wards. We evaluated the incidence of IA among all immunocompromised patients hospitalized in the three hematologic wards (2 adult wards and 1 pediatric ward) during this period. IA was categorized into proven  probable  and possible aspergillosis based on the revised European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria.                 Label=""Results"":A total of 15 patients was diagnosed with proven (1 case)  probable (8 cases)  or possible (6 cases) hospital-acquired IA during period 1. In period 2  14 patients were diagnosed with either proven (1 case)  probable (10 cases)  or possible (3 cases) hospital-acquired IA. Total mold and Aspergillus spp. spore levels in the air tended to be higher in period 1 (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.06 and 0.48  respectively). The incidence rate of all IA by the EORTC/MSG criteria was significantly higher in period 1 than in period 2 (1.891 vs. 0.930 per 1000 person-days  p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.05).                 Label=""Conclusions"":Airborne fungal spore levels tended to be higher during the period with heavier construction works involving demolition and excavation  during which the incidence of IA was significantly higher as well. We recommend monitoring airborne fungal spore levels during construction periods in hospitals with immunocompromised patients. Subsequently  the effect of airborne fungal spore level monitoring in reducing hospital-acquired IA should be evaluated. "

Repeated bacterial and viral RTI  such as pneumonia from encapsulated microorganisms  respiratory tract infections related to respiratory syncytial virus or influenza  and even the development of bronchiectasis and asthma  are often reported as the first symptom of primary immunodeficiencies. In the same way  neutropenia is a well-known risk factor for invasive aspergillosis  as well as lymphopenia for Pneumocystis  and mycobacterial infections. However  in the last decades a better knowledge of immune signaling networks and the introduction of next generation sequencing have increased the number and diversity of known inborn errors of immunity. On the other hand  the use of monoclonal antibodies targeting cytokines  such as tumor necrosis factor alpha has revealed new risk groups for infections  such as tuberculosis. The use of biological response modifiers has spread to almost all medical specialties  including inflammatory diseases and neoplasia  and are being used to target different signaling networks that may mirror some of the known immune deficiencies. From a clinical perspective  the individual contribution of genetics  and/or targeted treatments  to immune dysregulation is difficult to assess. The aim of this article is to review the known and newly described mechanisms of impaired immune signaling that predispose to RTI  including new insights into host genetics and the impact of biological response modifiers  and to summarize clinical recommendations regarding vaccines and prophylactic treatments in order to prevent infections."

Genetic and environmental factors are crucial in regulating the interaction between the host and Aspergillus. The role played by the enzyme indoleamine 2 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1)  which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of tryptophan catabolism along the kynurenine pathway  is increasingly being recognized  but whether and how genetic variation of IDO1 influences the risk of aspergillosis in susceptible patients is incompletely understood. In addition  whether the closely related protein IDO2 plays a similar role remains unexplored. In the present study  we performed genetic association studies in two different cohorts of susceptible patients [cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)]  and identified IDO1 polymorphisms that associate with the risk of infection in both cohorts. By using human bronchial epithelial cells and PBMC from CF and HSCT patients  respectively  we could show that the IDO1 polymorphisms appeared to down-modulate IDO1 expression and function in response to IFN<U+03B3> or Aspergillus conidia  and to associate with an increased inflammatory response. In contrast  IDO2 polymorphisms  including variants known to profoundly affect protein expression and function  were differently associated with the risk of aspergillosis in the two cohorts of patients as no association was found in CF patients as opposed to recipients of HSCT. By resorting to a murine model of bone marrow transplantation  we could show that the absence of IDO2 more severely affected fungal burden and lung pathology upon infection with Aspergillus as compared to IDO1  and this effect appeared to be linked to a deficit in the antifungal effector phagocytic activity. Thus  our study confirms and extends the role of IDO1 in the response to Aspergillus  and shed light on the possible involvement of IDO2 in specific clinical settings."

In total  58 studies from 267 centres reported 7320 patients with IA and 40 different predictors. Unfavourable predictors in medical history were kidney (7.4%  10/136) and liver failure (3.7%  5/136)  ICU admission (3.7%  5/136) and uncontrolled underlying disease (3.7%  5/136).

We used a multivariable logistic regression to estimate the 60-day probability of developing probable or proven IMD. The model was internally validated using a bootstrap resampling procedure.                 Label=""RESULTS"":The prevalence of IMD was 3.3% (90 probable cases  43 proven cases). Seven risk factors were retained in the final risk model: (1) uncontrolled malignancy  (2) high-risk chemotherapy regimen  (3) high-dose corticosteroids  (4) severe lymphopenia  (5) CMV reactivation or disease  (6) prolonged neutropenia  and (7) a history of previous IMD within 90 days.

Among 2145 patients in this study  192 developed TA-TMA with a cumulative incidence of 7.6% by 100days post-transplant. Independent pretransplant risk factors included the receipt of a second (or third) allogeneic HCT  HLA-mismatched donor  and myeloablative conditioning with or without total body irradiation; post-transplant risk factors included the antecedent development of acute graft-versus-host disease  diffuse alveolar hemorrhage  bacteremia  invasive aspergillosis  BK viremia  and higher sirolimus trough level. Among TA-TMA patients 27% achieved hematologic resolution and 57% remained alive as of 90days after diagnosis. Antecedent risk factors stratified patients into different survival groups  and immunosuppressant withdrawal alone did not improve patient outcomes. In conclusion  TA-TMA is a heterogenous disease that occurs after allogeneic transplantation. Management with immunosuppressant withdrawal does not impact patient outcomes. Until further evidence becomes available  the management of TA-TMA should focus on the treatment of underlying diseases."

Such missed diagnoses are obviously encountered when appropriate diagnostic tools are not available especially in low resource areas or when biologists have not been trained enough in medical mycology (i.e.  microscopic examination and culture in most of those areas). Besides logistical issues  which are indeed critical  IA may not be recognized because clinicians failed to consider that risk factors are evolving with the IA burden now observed among patients with chronic lymphoid malignancies or receiving new biotherapies  with diabetes mellitus or liver cirrhosis and/or acute alcoholic hepatitis  with patients from the intensive care unit (ICU) and among patients with some predisposing primary immune deficiencies now reaching the adult's age. This is also the case for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who failed to meet the classical definitions of IA. From the radiology perspective  new entities of IA have also emerged which absolutely need to be recognized especially bronchial-based-IA among allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. Finally  from the laboratory side  contribution and limits of indirect blood biomarkers should be integrated to the clinical life in order not to miss IA cases. To conclude  several diagnostic tools should be combined and a constant dialog between laboratory and clinics is crucial to appropriately diagnose IA."

Triazoles are the mainstay of anti-fungal prophylaxis while the other measures revolve around reducing exposure to mold spores. Three levels of treatment have been identified: (a) empiric  (b) pre-emptive  and (c) targeted treatment. Empiric is initiated in febrile neutropenic patients and uses mainly caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB).

This retrospective study assessed Aspergillus fumigatus real time qPCR (MycoGENIE®) in BAL to diagnose IA and identify azole-resistant strains. Clinical  radiological  and microbiological data from 114 hematology patients (69% HSCT recipients; 29% on mould active agents) from years 2012-2017 were collected; and 123 BAL samples were tested with qPCR (cutoff: Ct &lt; 40) and galactomannan (GM  Platelia®  cutoff: 0.5 ODI). Patients were classified as proven/probable  possible  and no-IA. &quot;Atypical-IA&quot; referred to patients with lesions other than typical according to 2008-EORTC/MSG and positive mycology. Proven IA was diagnosed in two cases (1.6%)  probable in 28 (22.8%)  possible in 27 (22%)  atypical in 14 (11.4%). qPCR was positive in 39 samples (31.7%). Sensitivity and specificity of qPCR for proven/probable IA (vs no-IA; atypical-IA excluded) were 40% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23-59) and 69% (95%CI: 55-81)  respectively. Sensitivity of qPCR was higher when combined with GM (83%  95%CI: 65-94) and in those receiving mould-active agents at BAL (61%  95%CI: 32-86). One sample had TR34/L98H mutation. In conclusion  in high-risk hematology patients with various lung lesions  A. fumigatus qPCR in BAL contributes to diagnosing IA  particularly if combined with GM and in patients receiving mould-active agents might allow detecting azole-resistant mutations in culture negative samples."

A prospective observational study was carried out between August 2016 and March 2018 in the medical intensive care unit. Patients above the age of 14 years with endotracheal intubation and/or central venous catheter for at-least three days and sepsis (not responding to 48 hours of intravenous antibiotic therapy) were included in the study. Suitable samples were collected and were subjected to fungal diagnostics. Invasive fungal disease was defined according to standard guidelines. Of the 100 recruited patients  a total of 11 patients had invasive aspergillosis  three patients had invasive candidiasis and one patient had both invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. IFI was more commonly seen in patients with auto-immune diseases (p = 0.002  odds ratio-10.13 (95% CI: 2.3-44)). A mortality of 73% was observed in patients with IFI. In conclusion  IFI  especially aspergillosis is grossly under-reported in critical settings.

Significant risk factors for invasive aspergillosis in liver recipients include corticosteroid therapy  neutropenia  T-cell dysfunction  renal failure and requirement for renal replacement therapy. Aspergillus infection usually affects the lungs of liver recipients  with hematogenous dissemination occurring in 50%-60% of cases. Renal involvement is rare and is considered to occur in 0.4% of all cases of invasive aspergillosis.                 Label=""CASE SUMMARY"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":This paper describes a case of a liver recipient presenting with a newly formed renal mass a year after liver transplantation. The patient underwent liver transplantation due to alcoholic liver cirrhosis  with preoperative corticosteroid therapy and postoperative immunosuppressants (tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil). His 1-year follow-up was uneventful  with a satisfying graft function and lack of any symptoms. During a routine follow-up abdominal ultrasound  he was diagnosed with a renal tumor. The renal imaging findings were inconclusive (with a differential diagnosis to renal cell carcinoma)  while the computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed scar tissue in the lungs suggestive of previous inflammation. The patient underwent radical nephrectomy  with histopathological analysis showing renal aspergilloma  yielding postoperative treatment with voriconazole. His follow up was uneventful  and the chest CT did not show any change in pulmonary lesions.

However  recent advances in clinical practice have likely improved outcomes of these patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children (&lt;18years of age) undergoing UCBT at Duke University between January 1  1995 and December 31  2014. We compared 2-year all-cause and cause-specific mortality during 3 time periods based on year of transplantation (1995 to 2001  2002 to 2007  and 2008 to 2014). We used multivariable Cox regression to identify demographic and UCBT characteristics that were associated with all-cause mortality  transplantation-related mortality  and death from invasive aspergillosis after adjustment for time period. During the 20-year study period 824 children underwent UCBT. Two-year all-cause mortality declined from 48% in 1995 to 2001 to 30% in 2008 to 2014 (P<U+202F>=<U+202F>.0002). White race and nonmalignant UCBT indications were associated with lower mortality. Black children tended to have a higher risk of death for which GVHD (18% versus 11%; P<U+202F>=<U+202F>.06) or graft failure (9% versus 3%; P<U+202F>=<U+202F>.01) were contributory than white children. Comparing 2008 to 2014 with 1995 to 2001  more than half (59%) of the reduced mortality was attributable to a reduction in infectious mortality  with 45% specifically related to reduced mortality from invasive aspergillosis. Antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole was associated with lower mortality from invasive aspergillosis than low-dose amphotericin B lipid complex (hazard ratio  .09; 95% confidence interval  .01 to .76). With the decline in mortality from invasive aspergillosis  adenovirus and cytomegalovirus have become the most frequentinfectious causes of death in children after UCBT. Advances in clinical practice over the past 20years improved survival of children after UCBT. Reduced mortality from infections  particularly invasive aspergillosis  accounted for the largest improvement in survival and was associated with use of voriconazole for antifungal prophylaxis."

The main human pathogens are Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii  which have a worldwide distribution. In contrast to cryptococcal meningitis  pulmonary cryptococcosis is still underdiagnosed because of limitations in diagnostic tools. It can mimic lung cancer  pulmonary tuberculosis  bacterial pneumonia  and other pulmonary mycoses both clinically and radiologically. Pulmonary nodules are the most common radiological feature  but these are not specific to pulmonary cryptococcosis. The sensitivity of culture of respiratory samples for Cryptococcus is poor and a positive result may also reflect colonisation. Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) with lateral flow device is a fast and sensitive test and widely used on serum and cerebrospinal fluid  but sera from patients with pulmonary cryptococcosis are rarely positive in the absence of disseminated disease. Detection of CrAg from respiratory specimens might assist the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis but there are very few data. Molecular detection techniques such as multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) could also provide better sensitivity but these still require validation for respiratory specimens. The first line of treatment for pulmonary cryptococcosis is fluconazole  or amphotericin B and flucytosine for those with central nervous system involvement. Pulmonary cryptococcosis worsens the prognosis of cryptococcal meningitis. In this review  we summarize the biological aspects of Cryptococcus and provide an update on the diagnosis and management of pulmonary cryptococcosis."

This review summarizes the available literature on the association of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) with severe influenza [influenza-associated aspergillosis (IAA)]  including epidemiology  diagnostic approaches and treatment options.                 Label=""RECENT FINDINGS"":Though IPA typically develops in immunodeficient patients  non-classically immunocompromised patients such as critically ill influenza patients are at high-risk for IPA as well. The morbidity and mortality of IPA in these patients is high  and in the majority of them  the onset occurs early after ICU admission. At present  standard of care (SOC) consists of close follow-up of these critically ill influenza patients with high diagnostic awareness for IPA. As soon as there is clinical  mycological or radiological suspicion for IAA  antifungal azole-based therapy (e.g. voriconazole) is initiated  in combination with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Antifungal treatment regimens should reflect local epidemiology of azole-resistant Aspergillus species and should be adjusted to clinical evolution. TDM is necessary as azoles like voriconazole are characterized by nonlinear pharmacokinetics  especially in critically ill patients.                 Label=""SUMMARY"":In light of the frequency  morbidity and mortality associated with influenza-associated aspergillosis in the ICU  a high awareness of the diagnosis and prompt initiation of antifungal therapy is required. Further studies are needed to evaluate the incidence of IAA in a prospective multicentric manner  to elucidate contributing host-derived factors to the pathogenesis of this super-infection  to further delineate the population at risk  and to identify the preferred diagnostic and management strategy  and also the role of prophylaxis.

Although there is extensive knowledge of the risk factors for these infections as single entities  the inter-relationship between opportunistic fungii and CMV has not been comprehensively explored.                 Label=""RECENT FINDINGS"":Both solid organ and stem cell transplant recipients who develop CMV invasive organ disease are at an increased risk of developing IFD  particularly aspergillosis and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Moreover  CMV viremia and recipient CMV serostatus also increased the risk of both early and late-onset IFD. Treatment-related factors  such as ganciclovir-induced neutropenia and host genetic Toll-like receptor (TLR) polymorphisms are likely to be contributory. Less is known about the relationship between CMV and IFD outside transplantation  such as in patients with hematological cancers or other chronic immunosuppressive conditions. Finally  few studies report on the relationship between CMV-specific treatments or the viral/antigen kinetics and its influence on IFD management.                 Label=""SUMMARY"":CMV infection is associated with increased risk of IFD in posttransplant recipients because of a number of overlapping and virus-specific risk factors. Better understanding of how CMV virus  its related treatment  CMV-induced immunosuppression and host genetic factors impact on IFD is warranted. "

The demographical  clinical  laboratory details and outcomes were analysed.                 Label=""RESULTS"":Out of 264 patients with ACLF  54 (20.4%) patients with suspicion of IFI were evaluated and IFI was diagnosed in 39 (14.7%). Invasive candidiasis was documented in 25 (64.1%) and invasive aspergillosis in 14 (35.8%). The most common source of infection was respiratory (n = 13) followed by renal (n = 7) and spontaneous fungal peritonitis (n = 6). On univariate analysis  diabetes mellitus  hemodialysis  prior antibiotic use  cerebral and respiratory organ failures  Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-OF and CLIF-C ACLF) scores were predictors for development of IFI (P &lt; 0.05). On multivariate analysis  hemodialysis and prior antibiotics use predicted the development of IFI (P &lt; 0.05). Non-survivors were more likely to have IFI (P = 0.029)  high CLIF-OF and CLIF-C ACLF scores (P &lt; 0.001; for both) and higher 1 3-ß D Glucan (BDG) levels (P = 0.009).

Recently  genetic background has emerged as an unanticipated risk factor. For this reason  polymorphisms for genes encoding archetypal receptors involved in the opsonic and nonopsonic clearance of microbes  pentraxin-3 (PTX3) and Dectin-1  respectively  were studied and correlated with the risk of infection. Fungal  bacterial  and viral infections were registered for a group of 198 patients with high-risk hematological malignancies. Polymorphisms for the pentraxin-3 gene (PTX3) showed a significant association with the risk of fungal infection by Candida spp. and  especially  by Aspergillus spp. This link remained even for patients undergoing antifungal prophylaxis  thus demonstrating the clinical relevance of PTX3 in the defense against fungi. CLEC7A polymorphisms did not show any definite correlation with the risk of invasive mycosis  nor did they influence the expression of Dectin-1 isoforms generated by alternative splicing. The PTX3 mRNA expression level was significantly lower in samples from healthy volunteers who showed these polymorphisms  although no differences were observed in the extents of induction elicited by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and heat-killed Candidaalbicans  thus suggesting that the expression of PTX3 at the start of infection may influence the clinical outcome. PTX3 mRNA expression can be a good biomarker to establish proper antifungal prophylaxis in immunodepressed patients."

Although transplant procedures have changed over time  more late cases of IA are being observed. The objective of this study was to identify the pre- and post-transplant factors of IA in a large cohort of HSCT patients mainly transplanted with reduced-intensity conditioning. This multicenter  case-control study was carried out using data collected between 2005 and 2010 by the Surveillance des Aspergilloses Invasives en France program (Institut Pasteur  Paris) and the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation ProMISe registry. Four control subjects without IA were individually matched to each case based on the center  patient age  and year of the transplant. We identified 185 cases of probable and proven IA and 651 control subjects. The median date of IA after the transplant was 133 days  with 35 cases (19%) of early IA (before day 40)  33 cases (18%) of late IA (days 40 to 100)  and 117 cases (63%) cases of very late IA (after day 100). In the multivariate analysis early IA was significantly associated with a lack of engraftment  whereas late and very late IA were significantly associated with more than grade II acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); very late IA was also significantly associated with relapse and secondary neutropenia. Two-thirds of IA cases occurred more than 100 days after HSCT with different risk factors from those occurring earlier. Prophylactic strategies should consider the specific risk factors for late and very late IA  especially GVHD  relapse after transplant  and secondary neutropenia."

Aspergillus endocarditis (AE) is severe form of FE. Incidence of AE has increased and is expected to rise due to an increased frequency of invasive procedures  cardiac devices and prosthetic valves together with increased use of immune system suppressors. AE lacks most of the clinical criteria used to diagnose infective endocarditis (IE)  where blood culture is almost always negative  and fever may be absent. Diagnosis is usually late and in many cases is made post-mortem. Late or mistaken diagnosis of AE contribute to delayed and incorrect management of patients. In the current study we aimed to describe the clinical  laboratory and imaging characteristics of AE  to identify predictors of early diagnosis of this serious infection.                 Label=""METHODS"":Patients with definite/possible IE  as diagnosed by the Kasr Al-Ainy IE Working Group from February 2005 through June 2016  were reviewed in this study. We compared the demographic  clinical  laboratory and imaging criteria of AE patients to non-fungal IE patients.                 Label=""RESULTS"":This study included 374 patients with IE in which FE accounted for 43 cases. Aspergillus was the most common fungus (31 patients; 8.3%) in the patient group. Lack of fever and acute limb ischemia at presentation were significantly associated with AE (p &lt; 0.001  p = 0.014  respectively). Health care associated endocarditis (HAE) and prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) were the only significant risk factors associated with AE (p &lt; 0.001 for each). Mitral  non-valvular  and aortotomy site vegetations  as well as aortic abscess/pseudoaneurysm  were significantly associated with AE (p = 0.022  p = 0.004  p &lt; 0.001  and p &lt; 0.001  respectively). Through multivariate regression analysis  HAE  PVE  aortic abscess/pseudoaneurysm  and lack of fever were strongly linked to AE. The probability of an IE patient having AE with HAE  PVE  and aortic abscess/pseudoaneurysm  but no fever  was 0.92. In contrast  the probability of an IE patient having AE with fever  native valve IE  but no health-care associated IE and no abscess/pseudoaneurysm  was 0.003. Severe sepsis and mortality in the Aspergillus group were higher as compared to the non-fungal group (p = 0.098 and 0.097  respectively). Thirteen AE patients died during hospitalization. PVE  the use of single versus dual antifungal agents  severe heart failure  and severe sepsis were significant predictors of mortality (p = 0.008  0.012  0.003  and 0.01  respectively).                 Label=""CONCLUSION"":To our knowledge  this is the first study to address diagnostic criteria for AE. Through multivariate regression analysis  absence of fever  HAE  PVE  and aortic abscess/pseudoaneurysm were strong predictors of AE. Use of these criteria my lead to earlier diagnoses of AE. Early treatment of AE patients with voriconazole in combination with other antifungal agents may be possible based on the previously mentioned criteria  which may facilitate better patient outcomes.

Significant risk factors for IA on multivariate analysis included an increased number of pretransplant hospitalizations (OR 1.81  95% CI 1.19-2.76) and posttransplant acute cellular allograft rejection (ACR) (OR 1.99  95% 1.06-3.75). Following the implementation of targeted antifungal prophylaxis in 2009  IA was identified in 2 of 107 (2.0%) patients in Cohort 2.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"":Increased pretransplant hospitalizations and posttransplant ACR episodes represent significant risk factors for IA following cardiac transplant. Targeted antifungal prophylaxis in at-risk patients reduces the incidence of IA. "

Nevertheless  invasive fungal infections (IFI) represent a major hindrance to the favorable outcome of patients with hematologic malignancies. According to these observations  an appropriate prevention of IFI occurring in hematologic patients should be considered of paramount importance. However  the wide use of antifungal agents may facilitate the emergence of resistance and may be associated to the occurrence of severe adverse events and eventually may significantly increase the cost of therapeutic procedures. Areas covered: The aim of present review is to analyze advantages and disadvantages of primary antifungal prophylaxis (PAP) in hematologic patients. Expert commentary: Patients with AML/MDS undergoing intensive chemotherapy and patients receiving stem cell transplantation are at high risk of IFI  and therefore may benefit form PAP  although several additional factors should be carefully evaluated in our decision-making approach  including the local epidemiology and the prompt availability of diagnostic facilities. The advent of new treatment options for hematologic patients such as target therapies might facilitate the rise of new risk categories so far underestimated. "

Efficient immune recognition of Aspergillus is crucial to protect against infection  and previous studies suggested a role for NOD2 in this process. However  thorough investigation of the impact of NOD2 on susceptibility to aspergillosis is lacking. Common genetic variations in NOD2 has been associated with Crohn's disease and here we investigated the influence of these  genetic variations on the anti-Aspergillus host response. A NOD2 polymorphism reduced the risk of IA after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Mechanistically  absence of NOD2 in monocytes and macrophages increases phagocytosis leading to enhanced fungal killing  conversely  NOD2 activation reduces the antifungal potential of these cells. Crucially  Nod2 deficiency results in resistance to Aspergillus infection in an in vivo model of pulmonary aspergillosis. Collectively  our data demonstrate that genetic deficiency of NOD2 plays a protective role during Aspergillus infection."

We present a case of a patient with known Crohn's disease who developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. His clinical picture was further complicated by an uncommon immune response characterized by the development of granulomas encasing the Aspergillus forms found on his lung biopsy  likely representing a maladaptive response  possibly related to the effects of his granulomatous disease in the lungs.

IFIs are a significant complication in the management of immunocompromised cancer patients; such infections are associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality  particularly in many South-Asian countries  where IFI rates are increasing. We retrospectively analyzed IFI incidence data from 105 patients with newly diagnosed AML at a single center undergoing their first course of induction chemotherapy without primary antifungal prophylaxis between November 2008 and December 2014. Of 21 cases documented as proven/provable IFIs 16 (76%) were invasive aspergillosis  2 (10%) were mucormycosis infections  and 3 (14%) were proven yeast infections. The lung was the most commonly affected site (n = 16; 76%); 2 patients (10%) developed fungal sinusitis. IFI cases were more often males (P = 0.020). In multivariate analysis  patients with neutropenia lasting&gt;30 days were more than twice as likely to develop IFI (OR  2.24 [95% CI  2.81-31.11]  P&lt;0.001). We also confirmed patients with smoker and receiving parenteral nutrition during chemotherapy were significant associated with IFIs. Our findings suggest that antifungal prophylaxis should be considered for patients with AML during induction chemotherapy  particularly in patients from Southeastern Asia  an area of potentially high IFI rates. We recommend that clinicians determine which patients receiving induction chemotherapy for AML are at high risk of developing IFI  to allow for targeted therapeutic prophylaxis."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical  radiological and demographic characteristics and treatment responses of patients with IPA after MWA.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"":From January 2011 to January 2016  all patients who were treated by MWA of their lung tumors from six health institutions were enrolled in this study. Patients with IPA secondary to MWA were identified and retrospectively evaluated for predisposing factors  clinical treatment  and outcome.                 Label=""RESULTS"":The incidence of IPA secondary to lung MWA was 1.44% (23/1596). Of the 23 patients who developed IPA  six died as a consequence  resulting in a high mortality rate of 26.1%. Using computed tomography (CT)  pulmonary cavitation was the most common finding and occurred in 87.0% (20/23) of the patients. Sudden massive hemoptysis was responsible for one-third of the deaths (2/6). Most patients (22/23) received voriconazole as an initial treatment  and six patients with huge cavities underwent intracavitary lavage. Finally  17 patients (73.9%) achieved treatment success.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"":Lung MWA may be an additional host risk factor for IPA  particularly in elderly patients with underlying diseases and in patients who have recently undergone chemotherapy. Early and accurate diagnosis of IPA after MWA is critical for patient prognosis. Voriconazole should be given as the first-line treatment as early as possible. Bronchial artery embolization or intracavitary lavage may be required in some patients. "

Our study showed that recurrent vaginal candidiasis (&gt;4 episodes/year) was the most common of all cases with a diagnosis of candidiasis (n = 501 138). Oesophageal candidiasis (n = 5850) was most predominant among individuals with HIV infection.

Of the numerous recommendations  a few are summarized here. Chest computed tomography as well as bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with suspicion of pulmonary invasive aspergillosis (IA) are strongly recommended. For diagnosis  direct microscopy  preferably using optical brighteners  histopathology and culture are strongly recommended. Serum and BAL galactomannan measures are recommended as markers for the diagnosis of IA. PCR should be considered in conjunction with other diagnostic tests. Pathogen identification to species complex level is strongly recommended for all clinically relevant Aspergillus isolates; antifungal susceptibility testing should be performed in patients with invasive disease in regions with resistance found in contemporary surveillance programmes. Isavuconazole and voriconazole are the preferred agents for first-line treatment of pulmonary IA  whereas liposomal amphotericin B is moderately supported. Combinations of antifungals as primary treatment options are not recommended. Therapeutic drug monitoring is strongly recommended for patients receiving posaconazole suspension or any form of voriconazole for IA treatment  and in refractory disease  where a personalized approach considering reversal of predisposing factors  switching drug class and surgical intervention is also strongly recommended. Primary prophylaxis with posaconazole is strongly recommended in patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving induction chemotherapy.

Although considered to be less immunosuppressive than conventional immunochemotherapy  the observation of a few cases of invasive fungal infections in patients treated with ibrutinib prompted us to conduct a retrospective survey. We identified 33 cases of invasive fungal infections in patients receiving ibrutinib alone or in combination. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) was overrepresented (27/33) and was associated with cerebral localizations in 40% of the cases. Remarkably  most cases of invasive fungal infections occurred with a median of 3 months after starting ibrutinib. In 18/33 cases  other conditions that could have contributed to decreased antifungal responses  such as corticosteroids  neutropenia  or combined immunochemotherapy  were present. These observations indicate that ibrutinib may be associated with early-onset invasive fungal infections  in particular IA with frequent cerebral involvement  and that patients on ibrutinib should be closely monitored in particular when other risk factors of fungal infections are present."

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) occurs in patients with risk factors including prolonged neutropenia  neutrophil dysfunction  patient on cytotoxic drugs  steroid therapy  hematological malignancy  AIDS or in patients with bone marrow transplantation. A recently documented risk factor for IA is the exposure to environmental aspergillus spores at construction sites which makes it an important public health issue. We report here a case of primary CNS aspergillosis in an immunocompetent person who was initially diagnosed as a case of meningioma  and had a history of working in an area with excessive ongoing construction. He had no other primary focus of infection anywhere in the body. He was timely diagnosed and broad spectrum antifungals were started immediately.                 Label=""MATERIAL AND METHODS"":The brain biopsy and pus sampleas were subjected to direct microscopy using KOH mount and lactophenol cotton blue (LPCB) stain and culture on Sabourad's Dextrose Agar in Microbiology laboratory.

The possible risk factors  clinical presentation  and treatment of patients with simultaneous liver failure and IPA have received little attention in previous studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of IPA in patients with liver failure in an effort to reduce patient mortality. Methods The patients with liver failure (including acute liver failure   sub-acute liver failure   acute-on-chronic liver failure and chronic liver failure) were recruited from 2011 to 2016. The clinical data of these patients were retrieved for the study. Results In total  1077 patients with liver failure were included in this study. Of the 1077 patients  53 (4.9%) had IPA. Forty-four (83%) patients with IPA died. Independent risk factors for IPA were male sex (hazard ratio [HR]<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.542)  hepatorenal syndrome (HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.463)  antibiotic use (HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.631)  and steroid exposure (HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>18.615). Conclusions IPA is a fatal complication in patients with liver failure. Male sex  hepatorenal syndrome  antibiotic use  and steroid exposure were independent risk factors for IPA. When patients with liver failure have these risk factors and symptoms of pneumonia such as cough or hemoptysis  clinicians should be cautious about the possibility of IPA."

Therefore  rapid and noninvasive diagnostic tools are a pressing need for improved outcomes for fungal keratitis. Taking advantage of the highly specific fungal cell targeting properties of caspofungin  we have developed a fluorescent chemical probe with high selectivity against fungal pathogens. Utilizing fluorescence imaging technology  we have demonstrated a highly specific and sensitive detection of Aspergillus in a fungal keratitis model in mice as early as 5 min post-topical application of the probe.

The incidence of IA in high-risk hematology populations is relatively low (&lt;10%)  despite unavoidable Aspergillus exposure in patients with a potentially similar clinical risk.

This study screened for mutations in 322 hematology patients classified according to IA status and developed a predictive model based on genetic risk  established clinical risk factors  and diagnostic biomarkers. Genetic markers were determined by real-time PCR and  with clinical risk factors and Aspergillus PCR results  subjected to multilogistic regression analysis to identify a best-fit model for predicting IA. The probability of IA was calculated  and an optimal threshold was determined. Mutations in dectin-1 (rs7309123) and DC-SIGN (rs11465384 and rs7248637)  allogeneic stem cell transplantation  respiratory virus infection  and Aspergillus PCR positivity were all significant risk factors for developing IA and were combined in a predictive model.

Despite this  IPA remains a major cause of infection-related mortality in patients with haematological diseases. There are two main reasons for this. First  diagnosis of IPA remains a challenge  since risk factors and the clinical  radiological and mycological presentations vary not only by fungal disease stage  but also by patient group (eg neutropenic vs non-neutropenic patients). Diagnosis is particularly challenging in patients receiving mould-active prophylactic or empirical treatment  which reduces the sensitivity of all diagnostic tests for IPA. Second  treatment of IPA is complex due to unpredictable pharmacokinetic profiles of antifungal agents  small therapeutic window in terms of exposure and adverse events  and multiple drug-drug interactions through the CYP450 system. Here we report a case of a 23-year-old male with severe aplastic anaemia and subpleural nodules. Diagnostic tests for IPA obtained during ongoing mould-active empirical treatment were negative. Intravenous voriconazole was stopped after visual disturbances and hallucinations. The patient then had an anaphylactic reaction to liposomal amphotericin B and was switched to intravenous posaconazole  which had to be discontinued due to a significant increase in transaminase levels. He was treated with oral isavuconazole with reduced dosage  triggered by increasing transaminases under the standard dosage. Even under reduced dosage  blood concentrations of isavuconazole were high and treatment was successful. The case illustrates real-world challenges and unmet needs in the diagnosis and treatment of IPA in patients with haematological diseases."

Gliotoxin (GT) and bis-methyl-gliotoxin (bmGT) are secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus during invasive  hyphal growth and may prove diagnostically useful. Because IA pathophysiology and GT's role in virulence vary depending on the underlying host immune status  we hypothesized that GT and bmGT production in vivo may differ in three mouse models of IA that mimic human disease. We defined temporal kinetics of GT and bmGT in serum  bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lungs of A. fumigatus-infected chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)  hydrocortisone-treated  and neutropenic mice. We harvested lungs for assessment of fungal burden  histology and GT/bmGT biosynthetic genes' mRNA induction. GT levels were higher in neutropenic versus CGD or steroid-treated lungs. bmGT was persistently detected only in CGD lungs. GT  but not bmGT  was detected in 71% of sera and 50% of BALF of neutropenic mice; neither was detected in serum/BALF of CGD or steroid-treated mice. Enrichment of GT in Aspergillus-infected neutropenic lung correlated with fungal burden and hyphal length but not induction of GT biosynthetic genes. In summary  GT is detectable in mouse lungs  serum and BALF during neutropenic IA  suggesting that GT may be useful to diagnose IA in neutropenic patients."

Indoor mould growth is a potential health risk  even if a quantitative and/or causal relationship between the occurrence of individual mould species and health problems has yet to be established. Apart from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and mould-caused mycoses  only sufficient evidence for an association between moisture/mould damage and the following health effects has been established: allergic respiratory disease  asthma (manifestation  progression and exacerbation)  allergic rhinitis  hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis)  and increased likelihood of respiratory infections/bronchitis. In this context the sensitizing potential of moulds is obviously low compared to other environmental allergens. Recent studies show a comparatively low sensitizing prevalence of 3-10% in the general population across Europe. Limited or suspected evidence for an association exist with respect to mucous membrane irritation and atopic eczema (manifestation  progression and exacerbation). Inadequate or insufficient evidence for an association exist for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in children  rheumatism/arthritis  sarcoidosis and cancer. The risk of infection posed by moulds regularly occurring indoors is low for healthy persons; most species are in risk group 1 and a few in risk group 2 (Aspergillus fumigatus  A. flavus) of the German Biological Agents Act (Biostoffverordnung). Only moulds that are potentially able to form toxins can be triggers of toxic reactions. Whether or not toxin formation occurs in individual cases is determined by environmental and growth conditions  above all the substrate. In the case of indoor moisture/mould damage  everyone can be affected by odour effects and/or mood disorders. However  this is not a health hazard. Predisposing factors for odour effects can include genetic and hormonal influences  imprinting  context and adaptation effects. Predisposing factors for mood disorders may include environmental concerns  anxiety  condition  and attribution  as well as various diseases. Risk groups to be protected particularly with regard to an infection risk are persons on immunosuppression according to the classification of the German Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention (Kommission für Krankenhaushygiene und Infektionsprävention  KRINKO) at the Robert Koch- Institute (RKI) and persons with cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis); with regard to an allergic risk  persons with cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) and patients with bronchial asthma should be protected. The rational diagnostics include the medical history  physical examination  and conventional allergy diagnostics including provocation tests if necessary; sometimes cellular test systems are indicated. In the case of mould infections the reader is referred to the AWMF guideline &quot;Diagnosis and Therapy of Invasive Aspergillus Infections&quot;. With regard to mycotoxins  there are currently no useful and validated test procedures for clinical diagnostics. From a preventive medicine standpoint it is important that indoor mould infestation in relevant dimension cannot be tolerated for precautionary reasons. With regard to evaluating the extent of damage and selecting a remedial procedure  the reader is referred to the revised version of the mould guideline issued by the German Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt  UBA)."

The endemic fungi Histoplasma capsulatum  Coccidioides spp  Blastomyces dermatitidis  and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis  and occasionally Aspergillus fumigatus  are primary pulmonary pathogens of otherwise healthy people. Such infections resolve in most people  and only a few infections lead to disease. However  many fungi are directly allergenic by colonising the respiratory tract or indirectly through contact with cell wall constituents and proteases  causing or exacerbating allergic disease. Increasing evidence implicates high indoor fungal exposures as a precipitant of asthma in children and in worsening asthma symptoms. Lung or airways infection by endemic fungi or aspergillus can be diagnosed with respiratory sample culture or serum IgG testing. Sputum  induced sputum  or bronchial specimens are all suitable specimens for detecting fungi; microscopy  fungal culture  galactomannan antigen  and aspergillus PCR are useful tests. Antifungal treatment is indicated in almost all patients with chronic cavitary pulmonary infections  chronic invasive and granulomatous rhinosinusitis  and aspergillus bronchitis. Most patients with fungal asthma benefit from antifungal therapy. Adverse reactions to oral azoles  drug interactions  and azole resistance in Aspergillus spp limit therapy.

Four triazole antifungal drugs  voriconazole  posaconazole  itraconazole  and isavuconazole  are approved to treat invasive aspergillosis either as first- or second-line therapy. All of these agents are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4  which plays a key role in metabolizing immunosuppressant drugs such as cyclosporine  tacrolimus  and sirolimus. Thus  co-administration of a triazole antifungal drug with these immunosuppressant drugs can potentially increase plasma concentrations of the immunosuppressant drugs  thereby resulting in toxicity  or upon discontinuation  inadvertently decrease the respective concentrations with increased risk of rejection or graft-versus-host disease. In this article  we review the evidence for the extent of inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 by each of these triazole antifungal drugs and assess their effects on cyclosporine  tacrolimus  and sirolimus. We also consider other factors affecting interactions of these two classes of drugs.

SNA is mainly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus  a ubiquitous saprophytic filamentous fungus. Infection is thought to follow inhalation of spores. SNA is a disease of the nasal cavity and/or sinuses with variable degrees of local invasion and destruction. While some host factors appear to predispose to SNA (such as belonging to a dolichocephalic breed)  environmental risk factors have been scarcely studied. Because A. fumigatus is also the main cause of invasive aspergillosis in humans  unraveling the distribution and the environmental and climatic risk factors for this agent in dogs would be of great benefit for public health studies  advancing understanding of both distribution and risk factors in humans. In this study  we reviewed electronic medical records of 250 dogs diagnosed with SNA between 1990 and 2014 at the University of California Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH). A 145-mile radius catchment area around the VMTH was selected. Data were aggregated by zip code and incorporated into a multivariate logistic regression model. The logistic regression model was compared to an autologistic regression model to evaluate the effect of spatial autocorrelation. Traffic density  active composting sites  and environmental and climatic factors related with wind and temperature were significantly associated with increase in disease occurrence in dogs. Results provide valuable information about the risk factors and spatial distribution of SNA in dogs in Northern California. Our ultimate goal is to utilize the results to investigate risk-based interventions  promote awareness  and serve as a model for further studies of aspergillosis in humans."

To better understand the differences in terms of clinical significance of IA between allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) recipients and patients treated for leukemia  we report a single-center study of 735 unselected consecutive patients treated between 2000 and 2004  before the era of systematic AP. Probable or confirmed IA were observed in 29 patients (2008 EORTC/MSG criteria)  including 7/235 undergoing allo-SCT (5.2%)  19/380 treated for acute leukemia (5.0%)  1/116 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (0.9%) and 2/104 for myelodysplastic syndrome (1.9%). In allo-SCT recipients  IA occurred later than in leukemia patients  after the neutropenic period. The median time between the last treatment and the diagnosis of IA was 231 days (range  68-341) in allo-SCT recipients and 17 days (6-57) in leukemia patients (P&lt;0.001). Importantly  the 7 cases of IA after allo- SCT occurred only in patients treated with corticosteroids for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Mortality directly related to IA was 24%. The 100-day  2-year and 10-year overall survival were 42.9%  0%  0% in allo-SCT recipients compared to 68.1%  18.2%  13.6% in leukemia patients  respectively (P=0.05). These poor outcomes were mainly attributable to non-relapse mortality (NRM). In conclusion  our data allows distinguishing 2 types of IA occurring at different time in the treatment course. In both cases  the NRM is very high and treatment remains challenging. Thus  systematic broad-spectrum AP against Aspergillus should be considered in acute leukemia patients during the neutropenic phase and in all patients undergoing allo-SCT who develop GVHD."

The main risk group of individuals for this organism is leukopenic patients  individuals having cancers  bone marrow transplant persons and those who have immunological disorders. The lack of early diagnostic marker for A. terreus and intrinsic resistance to Amphotericin B  further limits the successful therapy of A. terreus-associated infections. The germination of inhaled conidia is the key step to establish successful invasion in host tissues or organs. Thus  profiling of expressed proteins during germination of conidia not only shed light on proteins that are involved in invasion or virulence but may also provide early diagnostic markers. We used nanoLC-Q-TOF to study the proteome of germinating conidia (at 16 h time points) of A. terreus. We observed expression of 373 proteins in germinating conidia of A. terreus. A total of 74 proteins were uncharacterized in the database. The expressed proteins were associated with various processes like cell wall modulation  virulence factors and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The most abundant proteins were associated with protein biosynthesis  carbohydrate metabolism and unknown functions. Among virulent proteins  mitogen-activated protein kinase (hog1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (mpkC) are key virulent proteins observed in our study. We observed 7 enzymes from terretonin and 10 enzymes from geodin mycotoxin biosynthesis pathway. Interestingly  we observed expression of terrelysin protein  associated with blood cell lysis. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed 26-fold increase in transcripts encoding for dihydrogeodin oxidase and 885-fold for terrelysin gene in germinating conidia in comparison to conidia.

We evaluated the role of G6PD deficiency in susceptibility of IFD in 108 AML patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. In all  28 patients harbored G6PD deficiency (G6PD-)  whereas 80 were normal (G6PD<U+2009>+). Incidence of IFD was significantly higher in G6PD-<U+2009>patients compared to G6PD<U+2009>+<U+2009>patients (35.7% vs. 5%  p<U+2009>=<U+2009>.0002  OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>10  95% CI<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.96-37.5).

The study investigated the performance of a set of biomarkers for diagnosis of IFD in a mixed specialty critical care unit (CrCU).                 Label=""METHODS"":A prospective observational study in patients receiving critical care for =7days was performed. Serum samples were tested for the presence of: (1-3) - ß-d-glucan (BDG)  galactomannan (GM)  and Aspergillus fumigatus DNA. GM antigen detection was also performed on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples. The patients were classified using published definitions for IFD and a diagnostic algorithm for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Performance parameters of the assays were determined.                 Label=""RESULTS"":In patients with proven and probable IFD  the sensitivity  specificity  PPV and NPV of a single positive BDG were 63%  83%  65% and 83% respectively. Specificity increased to 86% with 2 consecutive positive results. The mean BDG value of patients with proven and probable IFD was significantly higher compared to those with fungal colonization and no IFD (p value&lt;0.0001).                 Label=""CONCLUSION"":New diagnostic criteria which incorporate these biomarkers  in particular BDG  and host factors unique to critical care patients should enhance diagnosis of IFD and positively impact antifungal stewardship programs.

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Severe invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are becoming increasingly frequent in critically ill patients. Approximately 80% of IFIs are due to Candida spp. and 0.3-19% to Aspergillus spp. Recent observations emphasize the necessity of building a worldwide sentinel network to monitor the emergence of new fungal species and changes in susceptibility. Robust data on the attributable mortality are essential for the design of clinical studies with mortality endpoints. Although early antifungal therapy for Candida has been recommended in patients with risk factors  sepsis of unknown cause  and positive Candida serum biomarkers [ß-1 <U+2192> 3-D-glucan (BDG) and Candida albicans germ tube antibody (CAGTA)]  its usefulness and influence on outcome need to be confirmed.

Here  we describe 3 patients with CLL and 1 with mantle cell lymphoma who developed severe life-threatening pneumonias  during monotherapy with ibrutinib. The first case was a 70-year-old woman with relapsed CLL who developed bilateral pneumonia with hypoxia 1 week after starting ibrutinib. She did not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotics and was treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and improved. In the second case  we describe a 76-year-old woman with relapsed CLL who developed recurrent pneumonia after 3 years of treatment with ibrutinib. Presuming that ibrutinib was the cause of pneumonitis with secondary infection  it was stopped with subsequent improvement. The third patient a 67 year-old man died because of severe bilateral necrotizing pneumonia due to invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis with pulmonary hemorrhage. The fourth patient with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma died because of severe bilateral pneumonia  caused by pseudomonas and candida  despite receiving appropriate antibiotics. From this experience  we hypothesize that the etiology of severe pneumonia associated with ibrutinib treatment is probably multifactorial  involving factors like preexisting immune-suppression  drug induced pneumonitis and infections. We suggest that patients with CLL or other lymphoproliferative disorders with suspected pneumonia during monotherapy with ibrutinib should be very carefully evaluated and need to undergo complete diagnostic workup to establish an exact diagnosis. Understanding which patients with CLL or lymphoma treated with kinase inhibitors are at a higher risk for developing pulmonary complications could be one of the important future challenges  when selecting the best available therapy for these patients."

Label=""METHODS"":Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed (for each patient from his end date in the past study) and data from all respiratory processes suffered by patients up to April 2015 were recorded. Comparisons of variables were performed between colonized patients that developed aspergillosis and those that did not. A Kaplan-Meier curve was used to describe time to development of aspergillosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients for II-IV stages of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classification.

Non-established risk factors may include weight loss and a history of diabetes. Twenty-three patients without the classical risk factors for IA were identified retrospectively at Harbor UCLA Medical Center by discharge diagnosis over a 20 year period (1992-2012). None of the well-known risk factors are for Invasive Apergillious (IA). A history of weight loss was seen in 66% of the patients with IA (15 of 23). The weight loss ranged from 3.3 lbs to 43 lbs. In patients with weight loss the average loss was 22±3 lbs (mean±SEM).

This guideline shall help physicians to advise and treat patients exposed indoors to mold. Indoor mold growth is a potential health risk  even without a quantitative and/or causal association between the occurrence of individual mold species and health effects. Apart from the allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and the mycoses caused by mold  there is only sufficient evidence for the following associations between moisture/mold damages and different health effects: Allergic respiratory diseases  asthma (manifestation  progression  exacerbation)  allergic rhinitis  exogenous allergic alveolitis and respiratory tract infections/bronchitis. In comparison to other environmental allergens  the sensitizing potential of molds is estimated to be low. Recent studies show a prevalence of sensitization of 3-10% in the total population of Europe. The evidence for associations to mucous membrane irritation and atopic eczema (manifestation  progression  exacerbation) is classified as limited or suspected. Inadequate or insufficient evidence for an association is given for COPD  acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in children  rheumatism/arthritis  sarcoidosis  and cancer. The risk of infections from indoor molds is low for healthy individuals. Only molds that are capable to form toxins can cause intoxications. The environmental and growth conditions and especially the substrate determine whether toxin formation occurs  but indoor air concentrations are always very low. In the case of indoor moisture/mold damages  everyone can be affected by odor effects and/or impairment of well-being. Predisposing factors for odor effects can be given by genetic and hormonal influences  imprinting  context and adaptation effects. Predisposing factors for impairment of well-being are environmental concerns  anxieties  conditioning and attributions as well as a variety of diseases. Risk groups that must be protected are patients with immunosuppression and with mucoviscidosis (cystic fibrosis) with regard to infections and individuals with mucoviscidosis and asthma with regard to allergies. If an association between mold exposure and health effects is suspected  the medical diagnosis includes medical history  physical examination  conventional allergy diagnosis  and if indicated  provocation tests. For the treatment of mold infections  it is referred to the AWMF guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of invasive Aspergillus infections. Regarding mycotoxins  there are currently no validated test methods that could be used in clinical diagnostics. From the perspective of preventive medicine  it is important that mold damages cannot be tolerated in indoor environments."

Important risk factors are long lasting granulocytopenia with neutrophil counts below 500/µl for more than 10 days or graft-versus-host disease resulting from allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. For definite diagnosis of IFD  various diagnostic tools have to be applied  including conventional mycological culture and nonconventional microbiological tests such as antibody/antigen and molecular tests  as well as histopathology and radiology. In the last few years  various laboratory methods  like the Aspergillus GM immunoassay (Aspergillus GM EIA)  1 3-ß-D-glucan (BG) assay or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques have been developed for better diagnosis. Since no single indirect test  including radiological methods  provides the definite diagnosis of an invasive fungal infection  the combination of different diagnostic procedures  which include microbiological cultures  histological  serological and molecular methods like PCR together with the pattern of clinical presentation  may currently be the best strategy for the prompt diagnosis  initiation and monitoring of IFDs. Early start of antifungal therapy is mandatory  but clinical diagnostics often do not provide clear evidence of IFD. Integrated care pathways have been proposed for management and therapy of IFDs with either the diagnostic driven strategy using the preemptive antifungal therapy as opposed to the clinical or empirical driven strategy using the 'traditional' empirical antifungal therapy. Antifungal agents preferentially used for systemic therapy of invasive fungal infections are amphotericin B preparations  fluconazole  voriconazole  posaconazole  caspofungin  anidulafungin  micafungin  and most recently isavuconazole. Clinical decision making must consider licensing status  local experience and availability  pharmacological and economic aspects."

Fungal cultures were positive in six of these patients  indicating a 9.4% incidence of mycotic keratitis in this region  including four cases of A. flavus and two cases of Fusarium spp. The predisposing factors  clinical presentation  and success of the therapeutic approaches were further evaluated. For all cases  topical voriconazole was the first choice of treatment. Surgical procedures were required to control infection in 3 of the 4 cases  including intrastromal voriconazole injection for two cases and keratoplasty for one case. Predisposing factors included trauma (two cases  50%)  contact lens use (one case  25%)  and previous ocular surgery (one case  25%). The clinical presentations also differed  including a well-limited ulcer (one case)  an ulcer with an irregular feathery margin (one case)  and ulcers with satellite lesions (two cases). The mean duration between the time of presentation and definitive diagnosis by culture was 14 days (8-25 days).

Microbiome-mediated mechanisms of resistance allow therefore the control of fungal colonization  preventing the onset of overt disease  particularly in patients with underlying immune dysfunction. Here  we review this emerging area of research and discuss the contribution of the microbiota (and its dysbiosis)  including its immunoregulatory properties and relationship with the metabolic activity of commensals  to respiratory fungal diseases.

Microbial surveillance has been recognized as a fundamental component of resistance management. Surveillance information may be used to inform decisions regarding health services and research funding allocation  to guide local infection control in hospitals and communities  and to direct local and national drug policies and guidelines. Azole resistance frequencies have been based on screening of unselected A. fumigatus isolates  on the number of azole-resistant cases within a cohort of patients with a specific Aspergillus disease  or on analysis of patients within a specific risk group. The various surveillance approaches differ in their aims  as well as in their associated advantages and drawbacks. Nevertheless  a wide range of azole resistance frequencies has been reported  partly due to the denominator used. As most azole resistance is believed to develop in the environment and  as a consequence  azole-naive patients may present with azole-resistant aspergillosis  experts recommended a 10% resistance frequency threshold above which the standard treatment choice  i.e. voriconazole  should be reconsidered. We believe that local resistance rates based on Aspergillus disease and/or risk group should be leading for decisions regarding empirical antifungal therapy in specific units. In addition  patient factors should be considered  such as admission to the ICU. Collecting valid surveillance data may be challenging in azole resistance due to numerous factors that present potential biases. Surveillance research may benefit from further standardization  which may be facilitated through the recently instituted International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) Aspergillus Resistance Surveillance Working Group."

Frequent delay in diagnosis is associated with high mortality rates. Cultures from clinical specimens remain sterile in many cases and the diagnosis of IA often only relies on non-specific radiological signs in the presence of host risk factors. Tests for detection of galactomannan- (GM) and 1 3-ß-d-glucan (BDG) are useful adjunctive tools for the early diagnosis of IA and may have a role in monitoring response to therapy. However  the sensitivity and specificity of these fungal biomarkers are not optimal and variations between patient populations are observed.

Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (TLR1  TLR2  TLR3  TLR4.1  TLR4.2  TLR6  CLEC7A  CARD9  and INFG) were investigated among transplant recipients and donors.                 Label=""FINDINGS"":The incidence of IFD in this cohort was 16.9% (29/172). Median baseline serum concentrations of IL-15  IL-2R  CCL2  and MIP-1a were significantly higher whilst IL-4 was lower in patients with proven/probable IFD compared to those with no evidence of IFD. Baseline high IL-2R and CCL2 were associated with increased risk of IFD in the multivariate analysis (adjusted hazard ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.1-5.1; P = 0.037]  and hazard ratio 2.7 [95% CI 1.2-6.1; P = 0.016]  respectively). However  these differences were not significant in follow up measurements. Similarly  no significant independent prognostic value was associated with baseline cytokine profile.                 Label=""INTERPRETATION"":High baseline IL-2R and CCL2 concentrations were independent indicators of the risk of developing IFD and could be used to identify patients for enhanced prophylaxis and early antifungal therapy.

Of the 10.8 million population  85.5 % are adults and 27 % are over 60 years of age. The annual fungal disease estimates are as follows: 142 337 Greek women get recurrent vaginal thrush (2 632 cases/100 000 females); there are 889 cases of esophageal candidiasis (8.2 cases/100 000); annual incidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia is 112 cases; chronic pulmonary aspergillosis prevalence is 386 cases; there are 20 843 patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and 27 744 with severe asthma with fungal sensitization; candidaemia incidence is 541 cases (5.0/100 000); there are 81 cases of Candida peritonitis; invasive aspergillosis occurs in 1 125 patients. According to our calculations  194 067 individuals (1.79 cases/100 000) in Greece suffer from serious fungal diseases each year. This is the first attempt to determine the burden of fungal diseases in Greece  and provides a crude estimate on its impact on public health. "

Four cases of IFI (two possible  one probable aspergillosis and one proven candidemia) occurred in this series. The incidence rate of proven/probable IFI was 0.21% per treatment cycle and 1.6% per patient treated for the whole series  and 0.73% per treatment cycle and 4.1% per patient treated in those with severe neutropenia. Two patients died from IFI  leading to an IFI-attributable mortality rate of 1.65% per patient and 0.21% per treatment cycle. The numbers needed to treat with prophylaxis to prevent one case of IFI are 238 azacitidine cycles or 30 patients throughout their whole treatment course  and 137 azacitidine cycles or 24 patients among those with severe neutropenia.

Although several major risk factors contributing to the development of primary aspergillosis of the larynx have been discussed in the literature  there has been no mention of inhaled antibiotics causing this rare presentation to the best of our knowledge. We  therefore  highlight the use of inhaled tobramycin as a unique catalyst leading to the rapid onset of this rare presentation. "

This review provides an overview of the epidemiology and risk factors for common fungal infections seen in lung transplant recipients  evaluates the clinical efficacy and toxicity of the various antifungal agents used to prevent infection  and offers recommendations and opportunities for future research. Currently available data evaluating the efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis strategies is limited by a lack of prospective  randomized clinical trial data and variability in patient populations  prophylactic and immunosuppressive strategies  dosing  durations of use of antifungal agents  and definitions of invasive infection. There is controversy regarding significant risk factors for invasive fungal infection  which has limited the development and validation of targeted prophylactic strategies. Inhaled formulations of amphotericin B remain the most widely studied option for universal prophylaxis and have been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of invasive Aspergillosis as compared with no prophylaxis. Concern over early postoperative extrapulmonary infection may suggest a benefit of initial prophylaxis with a systemic azole. Long-term use of systemic antifungals is not optimal due to emerging evidence of long-term toxicities. Multicenter  randomized trials are needed to ascertain the optimal prophylactic strategy in lung transplant recipients. New agents and delivery mechanisms may offer additional opportunities for comparative research. "

The most common infectious agent is Aspergillus fumigatus. Infections caused by non-Aspergillus molds are more frequent for various reasons. The species distribution of non-Aspergillus molds varies in different locations. Furthermore  infections caused by Mucor and Penicillium are increasing  as are infections caused by species resistant to azoles and amphotericin B. Most centers use antifungal prophylaxis with inhaled amphotericin B or oral azoles. Early diagnosis and therapy is crucial. Reliable information on the local microbiological spectrum is a prerequisite for the effective treatment of molds with primary or secondary resistance to antimycotic drugs. "

Control recipients were matched (1:1 ratio) by center and date of transplantation. Overall mortality among cases was 60.8%  and 25.0% of living recipients experienced graft loss. Pretransplant diagnosis of chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD; odds ratio [OR]: 9.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-90.58; p = 0.041) and delayed graft function (OR: 3.40; 95% CI: 1.08-10.73; p = 0.037) were identified as independent risk factors for IPA among those variables already available in the immediate peritransplant period. The development of bloodstream infection (OR: 18.76; 95% CI: 1.04-339.37; p = 0.047) and acute graft rejection (OR: 40.73  95% CI: 3.63-456.98; p = 0.003) within the 3 mo prior to the diagnosis of IPA acted as risk factors during the subsequent period.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that this agent is efficacious as prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections in patients at high risk  and may also be useful as salvage therapy against invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. However  the bioavailability of posaconazole following administration by oral suspension  which was the only formulation clinically available for many years  is highly variable and negatively influenced by several factors. Because of this  many patients had subtherapeutic or undetectable posaconazole levels when the oral suspension was used. To overcome this limitation  a delayed-release tablet was developed and is now available for clinical use. Hot-melt extrusion technology is used to combine a pH-sensitive polymer with posaconazole to produce a formulation that releases the drug in the elevated pH of the intestine where absorption occurs rather than in the low-pH environment of the stomach. This results in enhanced bioavailability and increased posaconazole exposure. Studies in healthy volunteers have demonstrated significantly higher and more consistent exposures with the tablet formulation compared to the oral suspension. In addition  pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of the tablets were not significantly affected by medications that raise gastric pH or increase gastric motility  and the tablets could also be administered without regard to food. Similar results have also been found in patients at high risk for invasive fungal infections who have received posaconazole tablets. The tablet formulation also appears to be well tolerated to date  although data regarding clinical efficacy are needed. "

Five of the late-onset cases were invasive pulmonary aspergillosis  and 2 were fungemia cases. The mortality rate of late-onset IA was 80.0%. According to a multivariate analysis  steroid use before liver transplantation  bloodstream infection within 90 days after liver transplantation and reoperation within 90 days after liver transplantation were significant risk factors for late-onset IA after liver transplantation. The prevalence of IFI was low in our population given that over 80% of liver recipients received antifungal prophylaxis. The prognosis of late-onset IA remains poor  and predictors associated with late-onset IA  such as steroid use before liver transplantation  bloodstream infection and reoperation after liver transplantation  may help clinicians to optimize prevention measures for these devastating infections.

A clinical algorithm has been validated to discriminate colonization from putative invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (PIPA) in Aspergillus-positive respiratory tract cultures of critically ill patients. We focused on critically ill patients with COPD who met the criteria for PIPA.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":This matched cohort study included critically ill patients with COPD from two university hospital intensive care units (ICUs). We studied the risk factors for PIPA as well as the impact of PIPA on short- and long-term outcomes. Whether PIPA was associated with a pattern of bacterial colonization and/or infection 6 months before and/or during ICU stay was assessed. In addition  antifungal strategies were reviewed.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Fifty cases of PIPA in critically ill patients with COPD in the ICU were matched with one hundred control patients with COPD. The ICU short- and the long-term (at 1 year) mortality were significantly increased in the PIPA group (p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001 for all variables). PIPA was a strong independent risk factor for mortality in the ICU (odds ratio 7.44  95 % confidence interval 2.93-18.93  p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) before vasopressor therapy  renal replacement therapy  and duration of mechanical ventilation. Before ICU admission  the use of corticosteroids and antibiotics significantly increased the risk of PIPA (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.004 and p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001  respectively). No significant difference in bacterial etiologic agents responsible for colonization and/or infection was found between the groups. Antifungal treatment was started in 64 % of PIPA cases  with a poor impact on the overall outcome.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":PIPA was a strong death predictor in critically ill patients with COPD. The use of corticosteroids and antibiotics before ICU admission was a risk factor for PIPA. PIPA was not associated with a specific bacterial pattern of colonization or infection. Prompting antifungal treatment in critically ill patients with COPD who have PIPA may not be the only factor involved in prognosis reversal. "

We evaluated 358 sera from 78 febrile neutropenic episodes in patient with invasive aspergillosis (IA) (one proven  17 probable  and 60 possible) and 83 episodes in patients with no IA according to the EORTC/MSG criteria. Patient's specimens were tested by Mycassay Aspergillus PCR (first commercial real-time PCR test) and in house real-time PCR to investigate the presence of Aspergillus DNA  and by ELISA for detect the galactomannan (GM) antigen. We systematically investigated the medical background that can be effective on the test results. The hospitalisation period was longer in proven/probable episodes when compared with no IA (P = 0.001) and possible episodes. With regard to duration of neutropenia  the differences between both proven/probable with no IA (P = 0.023) and possible with no IA (P = 0.002) were highly significant. Similarly  the rates of T cell suppressant therapy in group proven/probable and possible episodes were significantly higher than in no IA (P = 0.005). There are significant differences in the performance of GM and PCR-based tests among studies  and standardisation is required. Therefore  it can be useful to determine the effective factors on these tests. The use of larger volume of sera improved the performance of real-time PCR for detection of Aspergillus DNA in high-risk adult patients in the present study. Some host factors such as duration of neutropenia and administration of T cell suppressants related to the development of IA. "

We sought to determine whether the antifungal prophylactic use of voriconazole reduces the incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in high-risk LT recipients without prohibitively increasing cost. During the study era (April 2008 to April 2014)  339 deceased donor LTs were performed. Of those patients  174 high-risk recipients were administered antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole. The median biological Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score at the time of LT was 33 (range  18-49) with 56% requiring continuous renal replacement therapy and 50% requiring ventilatory support immediately before transplantation. Diagnosis of IA was stratified as proven  probable  or possible according to previously published definitions. No IA was documented in patients receiving voriconazole prophylaxis. At 90 days after LT  the institutional cost of prophylaxis was $5324 or 5.6% of the predicted cost associated with post-LT aspergillosis. There was no documentation of resistant strains isolated from any recipient who received voriconazole. In conclusion  these data suggest that voriconazole prophylaxis is safe  clinically effective  and cost-effective in high-risk LT recipients."

Three centres applied the same protocol for in-house PCR  which was compliant with the European Aspergillus PCR Initiative recommendations  to guarantee the highest diagnostic standards. Two thousand one hundred and twenty-eight sera from 213 patients were investigated and stratified according to the revised European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria for invasive fungal disease.

Most common pulmonary fungal infections include aspergillosis  cryptococcosis  and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Among nosocomial bloodstream infections  Candida spp. is the most common isolated fungus. Mortality rates up to 60% in critically ill patients with Candida infections and 90% in hematological patients with invasive aspergillosis are reported. Furthermore  fungal infections contribute to high morbidity and prolonged hospitalizations. Since standard cultural methods can show low sensitivity or provide delayed responses  new non-culture-dependent methods such as galactomannan ß-D-glucan are now available. Novel antifungal compounds (e.g.  amphotericin B lipid formulations  last-generation azoles  and echinocandins) have been introduced in the recent years. Nevertheless  despite new advances the appropriate use of diagnostic assays along with a thorough therapeutic management remain the key to ensure an early appropriate targeted treatment that represents the crucial factor to attain a successful approach to severe fungal infections.

Fusarial pneumonia occurs almost exclusively in severely immunocompromised patients  especially acute leukemia patients and recipients of allogeneic cell transplantation. In such patients  invasive fusariosis is usually disseminated  and pneumonia occurs in almost 50% of cases. The radiologic picture is similar to invasive aspergillosis  with alveolar infiltrates  nodules with or without halo sign  ground-glass infiltrates  and pleural effusions. Different from aspergillosis is the frequent occurrence of disseminated nodular and papular skin lesions and positive blood cultures. The drug of choice for the treatment of invasive fusariosis is either voriconazole or liposomal amphotericin B.

The incidence has increased over the last decade and its mortality remains high at around 50%. Mucormycosis occurs mostly in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or in the context of immunosuppression resulting from chemotherapy for hematological malignancy  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  or solid-organ transplantation. In this situation  lung and rhino-orbito-cerebral infections are the most frequent localizations of the disease. Prompt initiation of an effective treatment is essential to decrease mortality. However  mucormycosis and aspergillosis share close clinical and radiological features. Invasive procedures such as bronchial endoscopy and/or lung biopsy are necessary to confirm diagnosis  as no indirect tests are yet validated. Therefore  the challenge is to minimize the delay in diagnosis. When present  the reversed halo sign on CT scan is suggestive of mucormycosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction is a new promising approach to detect Mucorales DNA in serum and new molecular tools are available to detect Mucorales in tissues as well as to specify species. Recommendations from ECIL and ECMM/ESCMID have recently been published on management of mucormycosis. The recommended treatment is an amphotericin B lipid formulation in combination with surgery and modification of risk factors. High-dose (10 mg/kg) of liposomal amphotericin B is recommended in case of neurological involvement and posaconazole for maintenance therapy. Place of isavuconazole as well as posaconazole new formulations (tablets and intravenous) in first line treatment have to be defined. Improved radiologic descriptions of mucormycosis and new molecular tools may be key elements to help with rapid diagnosis in the future. Clinical trials are warranted to improve therapeutic success and hopefully survival. "

However  there are only a few studies on IPA in immunocompromised children in Korea. This study was designed to characterize IPA in Korean children with hematologic/oncologic diseases. Medical records of children with hematologic/oncologic diseases receiving antifungal therapy were reviewed. The enrolled children were divided into the IPA group (proven and probable IPA) and non-IPA group  and the clinical characteristics and prognosis were compared between the two groups. During the study period  265 courses of antifungal therapy were administered to 166 children. Among them  two (0.8%) episodes of proven IPA  35 (13.2%) of probable IPA  and 52 (19.6%) of possible IPA were diagnosed. More children in the IPA group suffered from neutropenia lasting for more than two weeks (51.4% vs. 21.9%  P&lt;0.001) and showed halo signs on the chest computed tomography (78.4% vs. 40.7%  P&lt;0.001) than in the non-IPA group. No other clinical factors showed significant differences between the two groups. Amphotericin B deoxycholate was administered as a first line antifungal agent in 33 (89.2%) IPA group episodes  and eventually voriconazole was administered in 27 (73.0%) episodes. Ten (27.0%) children in the IPA group died within 12 weeks of antifungal therapy. In conclusion  early use of chest computed tomography to identify halo signs in immunocompromised children who are expected to have prolonged neutropenia can be helpful for early diagnosis of IPA and improving prognosis of children with IPA.

Invasive aspergillosis develops in severely immunocompromised patients  including those with neutropenia  and increasingly in the non-neutropenic host  including lung transplant recipients  the critically ill patients and patients on steroids. A high index of suspicion is required in patients without the classical risk factors as early presentation is usually silent and non-specific  pyrexia uncommon and timely treatment is crucial for survival. Invasive aspergillosis has also been diagnosed in normal hosts after massive exposure to fungal spores. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis affects patients without obvious immune compromise  but with an underlying lung condition such as COPD or sarcoidosis  prior or concurrent TB or non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease. Aspergillus bronchitis may be responsible for persistent respiratory symptoms in patients with Aspergillus detected repeatedly in sputum without evidence of parenchymal Aspergillus disease  especially in patients with bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis affects patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis  and is important to recognise as permanent lung or airways damage may accrue if untreated. Changes in the classification of Aspergillus allergic lung disease have been proposed recently. Cases of extrinsic allergic alveolitis and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis have been observed after Aspergillus exposure. Asymptomatic colonisation of the respiratory tract needs close monitoring as it can lead to clinical disease especially with ongoing immunosuppression. The various syndromes should be viewed as a semicontinuous spectrum of disease and one form may evolve into another depending on the degree of ongoing immunosuppression. "

We therefore analyzed the interactions between molds and the bronchial/bronchiolar epithelium at the early steps after inhalation. We developed invasive aspergillosis (Aspergillus fumigatus) and mucormycosis (Lichtheimia corymbifera) murine models that mimic the main clinical risk factors for these infections. Histopathology studies were completed with a specific computer-assisted morphometric method to quantify bronchial and alveolar spores and with transmission electron microscopy. Morphometric analysis revealed a higher number of bronchial/bronchiolar spores for A. fumigatus than L. corymbifera. The bronchial/bronchiolar spores decreased between 1 and 18 hours after inoculation for both fungi  except in corticosteroid-treated mice infected with A. fumigatus  suggesting an effect of cortisone on bronchial spore clearance. No increase in the number of spores of any species was observed over time at the basal pole of the epithelium  suggesting the lack of transepithelial crossing. Transmission electron microscopy did not show spore internalization by bronchial epithelial cells. Instead  spores were phagocytized by mononuclear cells on the apical pole of epithelial cells. Early epithelial internalization of fungal spores in vivo cannot explain the bronchial/bronchiolar epithelium invasion observed in some invasive mold infections.

Efficacy of voriconazole in these patients is critical to ensure positive outcomes and reduce mortality. However  a major limitation of voriconazole is the risk of adverse events such as hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity. As such  therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been suggested as a mechanism to optimize both efficacy and safety. The aim of this review was to summarize and evaluate evidence from the primary literature that assessed TDM outcomes for voriconazole as well as evaluate the association between CYP2C19 polymorphism and the clinical outcomes of voriconazole. Findings showed associations for both efficacy and safety outcomes with measurement of drug concentrations  yet exact targets or thresholds remain unclear. As such  TDM should be reserved for those patients not responding to therapy with voriconazole or those experiencing adverse drug reactions. Future studies should attempt to further define these populations within controlled settings. Studies that evaluated the effect of CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism on clinical outcomes found no significant relationship between CYP2C19 genotype and hepatotoxicity. These negative findings may be due to lack of power  use of phenotypes not well-defined  and the presence of other interacting factors that may impact voriconazole pharmacokinetics. Future well-designed studies are warranted to confirm these findings. "

We describe a 45-year-old male with ABPA treated with oral methylprednisolone and itraconazole  who developed acute respiratory failure secondary to IPA  a month later. The patient subsequently improved after systemic antifungal therapy. Presumably  itraconazole by inhibiting CYP3A4 enzyme caused an increase in plasma methylprednisolone levels. This probably led to a profound immunosuppressed state  which predisposed to the development of IPA. We performed a systematic review and identified nine cases of IPA following ABPA.

Recently  several studies have indicated a high incidence of IA in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However  few data are available on the epidemiology and outcome of patients with IA in this setting.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":An observational study including all patients with a positive Aspergillus culture during ICU stay was performed in 30 ICUs in 8 countries. Cases were classified as proven IA  putative IA or Aspergillus colonization according to recently validated criteria. Demographic  microbiologic and diagnostic data were collected. Outcome was recorded 12 weeks after Aspergillus isolation.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":A total of 563 patients were included  of whom 266 were colonized (47%)  203 had putative IA (36%) and 94 had proven IA (17%). The lung was the most frequent site of infection (94%)  and Aspergillus fumigatus the most commonly isolated species (92%). Patients with IA had higher incidences of cancer and organ transplantation than those with colonization. Compared with other patients  they were more frequently diagnosed with sepsis on ICU admission and more frequently received vasopressors and renal replacement therapy (RRT) during the ICU stay. Mortality was 38% among colonized patients  67% in those with putative IA and 79% in those with proven IA (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Independent risk factors for death among patients with IA included older age  history of bone marrow transplantation  and mechanical ventilation  RRT and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at diagnosis.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":IA among critically ill patients is associated with high mortality. Patients diagnosed with proven or putative IA had greater severity of illness and more frequently needed organ support than those with Aspergillus spp colonization. "

There were 12 patients who had dilated cardiomyopathy and 1 patient who had myocarditis before heart transplantation; 12 patients received immunosuppressive therapy in single or combination form. Pulmonary infections developed in the first month (1 patient)  from first to third month (6 patients)  from third to sixth month (1 patient)  and &gt; 6 months after transplantation (5 patients). Chest computed tomography showed consolidation (unilateral  9 patients; bilateral  4 patients). Multiple nodular consolidations were observed in 2 patients and a cavitary lesion was detected in 1 patient. Bronchoscopy was performed in 6 patients; 3 patients had Aspergillus fumigatus growth in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  and 2 patients had Acinetobacter baumannii growth in sputum. Treatment was empiric antibiotics (6 patients)  antifungal drugs (5 patients)  and both antibiotics and antifungal drugs (2 patients); treatment period was 1-12 months in patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Pulmonary infections are the most common cause of mortality in heart transplant recipients. A. fumigatus is the most common opportunistic pathogen. Heart transplant recipients with fever and cough should be evaluated for pulmonary infections  and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis should be suspected if these symptoms occur within the first 3 months. Immediately starting an empiric antibiotic is important in treating pulmonary infections in heart transplant recipients. "

We sought to determine the causes of death in these patients  the role that IA played in the cause  and the timing of death. The factors associated with IA-related mortality are also analyzed. We conducted a multicenter study (2008-2011) of cases of proven and probable IA. The causes of death and whether mortality was judged to be IA-related or IA-unrelated were determined by consensus using a six-member review panel. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine risk factors for IA-related death. Of 152 patients with IA  92 (60.5%) died. Mortality was judged to be IA-related in 62 cases and IA-unrelated in 30. The most common cause of IA-related death was respiratory failure (50/62 patients)  caused primarily by Aspergillus infection  although also by concomitant infections or severe comorbidities. Progression of underlying disease and bacteremic shock were the most frequent causes of IA-unrelated death. IA-related mortality accounted for 98% and 87% of deaths within the first 14 and 21 days  respectively. Liver disease (HR 4.54; 95% CI  1.69-12.23) was independently associated with IA-related mortality  whereas voriconazole treatment was associated with reduced risk of death (HR 0.43; 95% CI  0.20-0.93). In conclusion  better management of lung injury after IA diagnosis is the main challenge for physicians to improve IA outcomes. There are significant differences in causes and timing between IA-related and IA-unrelated mortality and these should be considered in future research to assess the quality of IA care. "

During induction therapy  he developed severe pneumonia. Although meropenem and micafungin were started  he died of circulatory failure owing to massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Autopsy specimens obtained from the stomach revealed fungal hyphae  which had invaded diffusely into submucosal vessels and caused the massive gastric bleeding. The same hyphae were also observed in both lungs. A diagnosis of disseminated zygomycosis was confirmed by its characteristic histopathological findings. Because zygomycetes are spontaneously resistant to the newer antifungal agents  such as voriconazole or micafungin  it seems likely that the prevalence of zygomycosis as a breakthrough infection may increase in the future. Zygomycosis is a rare  but life-threatening  deep fungal infection that appears in immunologically or metabolically compromised hosts. Its manifestations are clinically similar to those of invasive aspergillosis. In addition to the well-established epidemiology of zygomycosis  this case suggests the following new characteristics. (1) Although the gastrointestinal manifestation of zygomycosis is relatively rare  it is observed more frequently than invasive aspergillosis. (2) Gastrointestinal zygomycosis occasionally leads to the development of necrotic ulcers and may induce hemorrhagic shock.(3) We should be cautious of an occurrence of breakthrough zygomycosis when we use echinocandins for patients with known risk factors  especially steroid use and neutropenia. (4) For patients who are receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and echinocandins  who are negative for culture studies and aspergillus antigen  and who present with unresolved fever  it is important to make a prompt clinical diagnosis of zygomycosis."

Understanding how calcineurin inhibitors impair fungal immunity is a key priority for defining risk of infection. Here  we show that the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus impairs clearance of the major mould pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus from the airway  by inhibiting macrophage inflammatory responses. This leads to defective early neutrophil recruitment and fungal clearance. We confirm these findings in zebrafish  showing an evolutionarily conserved role for calcineurin signalling in neutrophil recruitment during inflammation. We find that calcineurin-NFAT activation is phagocytosis dependent and collaborates with NF-<U+03BA>B for TNF-a production. For yeast zymosan particles  activation of macrophage calcineurin-NFAT occurs via the phagocytic Dectin-1-spleen tyrosine kinase pathway  but for A. fumigatus  activation occurs via a phagosomal TLR9-dependent and Bruton's tyrosine kinase-dependent signalling pathway that is independent of MyD88. We confirm the collaboration between NFAT and NF-<U+03BA>B for TNF-a production in primary alveolar macrophages. These observations identify inhibition of a newly discovered macrophage TLR9-BTK-calcineurin-NFAT signalling pathway as a key immune defect that leads to organ transplant-related invasive aspergillosis."

Invasive aspergillosis develops in severely immunocompromised patients  including those with neutropenia  and increasingly in the non-neutropenic host  including lung transplant recipients  the critically ill patients and patients on steroids. A high index of suspicion is required in patients without the classical risk factors as early presentation is usually silent and non-specific  pyrexia uncommon and timely treatment is crucial for survival. Invasive aspergillosis has also been diagnosed in normal hosts after massive exposure to fungal spores. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis affects patients without obvious immune compromise  but with an underlying lung condition such as COPD or sarcoidosis  prior or concurrent TB or non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease. Aspergillus bronchitis may be responsible for persistent respiratory symptoms in patients with Aspergillus detected repeatedly in sputum without evidence of parenchymal Aspergillus disease  especially in patients with bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis affects patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis  and is important to recognise as permanent lung or airways damage may accrue if untreated. Changes in the classification of Aspergillus allergic lung disease have been proposed recently. Cases of extrinsic allergic alveolitis and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis have been observed after Aspergillus exposure. Asymptomatic colonisation of the respiratory tract needs close monitoring as it can lead to clinical disease especially with ongoing immunosuppression. The various syndromes should be viewed as a semicontinuous spectrum of disease and one form may evolve into another depending on the degree of ongoing immunosuppression. "

Because of leukemia's heterogeneity  the risk for IFDs is highly variable. We therefore apply a risk-adapted antifungal strategy with strong emphasis on pretreatment and day-15 posttreatment to allow earlier and more individualized interventions. We determine pretreatment risks for IFDs based on 4 factors: (1) host fitness for standard therapy (ie  fit  unfit  or frail); (2) leukemia resistance (high vs low probability of achieving complete remission [CR]); (3) anticipated treatment-related toxicity such as neutropenia  mucositis  and steroid-induced immunosuppression; and (4) patient exposure to opportunistic fungi. Accordingly  we stratify patients as high  intermediate  or low risk for IFDs and apply risk-adapted antifungal strategies  including primary or secondary prophylaxis and diagnostic-based preemptive or empiric therapy. Prevention of IFDs also relies on optimizing organ function  decreasing exposure to opportunistic fungi  and improving net state of immunosuppression with use of better-tolerated and investigational agents for unfit patients and those with adverse leukemia biology. Novel targeted and safe therapies that can achieve higher rates of sustained CR among patients with adverse genetics offer the best promise for reducing the burden of IFDs in these patients. "

It has been reported with a variety of clinical and radiological patterns. The condition should be distinguished from simple aspergilloma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis as well as invasive aspergillosis in severely immunocompromised patients. CPA generally requires long-term antifungal treatment and surgery may be considered. Life-threatening haemoptysis may be prevented by bronchial arteriography with embolisation. However  currently there are no documented treatment recommendations for CPA. This review provides an up-to-date practical overview of this condition  including a comprehensive update on diagnosis and management."

Patients being admitted to medical wards are usually older  have multiple comorbidities  e.g.  liver cirrhosis or chronic obstructive respiratory disease  may be malnourished or receive peripheral or total parenteral nutrition  and frequently are undergoing chronic corticosteroid therapy  chemotherapy for cancer or monoclonal antibodies for autoimmune diseases. Such risk factors may be contemporarily present in a single patient increasing the risk for the development of invasive mycoses. Diagnosis of candidemia and invasive aspergillosis is particularly difficult in patients hospitalized on medical wards  since symptoms and signs have low specificity  and most diagnostic tests have been only validated in neutropenic hematologic patients  but not in those without neutropenia. Both candidemia and invasive aspergillosis carry significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this paper is to provide a simple guide to physicians for a prompt identification and treatment of patients with possible or suspected invasive mycoses. "

Therefore  whereas meta-analyses focusing on clinical validation suggest interest in adding PCR results to the diagnostic workup for invasive fungal disease (IFD) along with clinical evaluation  CT scans  classical mycology and antigen detection  no consensual PCR method has emerged. Compared with the end-point format of the 1990s  real-time quantitative PCR is a major breakthrough. This format prevents contamination with previously amplified products  provides the yield of amplification  allows for developing consensus procedures and should therefore be the only format used. An internal control is now mandatory to avoid false-negative results. Primer design strongly impacts on the objectives: pan-fungal primers can provide false-positive results due to environmental fungal DNA contamination; conversely  species-specific primers miss infections caused by untargeted fungi. Unresolved issues include the best specimens to be used; serum is currently preferred to blood because of the ease of the DNA extraction step. Work is in progress to establish standards at least for Aspergillus PCR  and the implementation of quality controls should help centres to improve assays.

The aim of our study was to investigate the mold exposure of hematology patients both at home and at hospital to assess their invasive aspergillosis (IA) risk. Fungal exposure was assessed by quantifying opportunistic molds at hospital during hospitalization and in homes of 53 hematology patients. IA was diagnosed in 13 of 53 patients and invasive fungal infection (IFI) in one patient. In hospital  no opportunistic species  or low levels of opportunistic species  were found in 98% of weekly controls. Only 2% of hematology intensive care unit (ICU) controls showed a high level of Aspergillus fumigatus spores in corridor air. Five patients IA were hospitalized during these periods. Seven dwellings of 53 (5/14 dwellings of patients with IA/IFI and 2/39 dwellings of non-IA patients) had a percentage of A. fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus to total mold (significant predictor variable of IA/IFI in our study  general linear model  P-value = 0.02) as high as 15%. Maintaining a 'zero Aspergillus' goal at hospital is essential  and establishing specific and individually opportunistic mold monitoring at home could help to further reduce the IA risk through continuous surveillance.

IPA diagnosis is problematic and the true incidence of IPA is difficult to be estimated because of the nonspecific clinical presentation. A user-friendly clinical diagnostic algorithm for IPA is valuable  particularly through a high negative predictive value. IPA carries a poor prognosis and has an important impact on hospital costs. Timely diagnosis and prompt administration of appropriate treatment may improve the outcomes. Intravenous voriconazole is the recommended primary IPA treatment  but liposomal amphotericin B also has clinical utility.

Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":A single-center retrospective cohort study of CF-LTRs was conducted between 2006 and 2010. Respiratory tract cultures before transplantation were reviewed to identify patients with pretransplant Aspergillus colonization. Patients with positive Aspergillus sputum culture or positive bronchoalvelolar lavage (BAL) galactomannan after transplantation were classified as having colonization or disease according to the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":A total of 93 CF patients underwent lung transplantation. Seventy percent (65/93) of CF-LTRs had pretransplant Aspergillus colonization. Thirty-six patients had positive intraoperative Aspergillus culture from the native lung BAL. Overall  22.5% (20/93) of CF-LTRs developed IA. Median time to IA was 42 days following transplantation. Positive intraoperative Aspergillus culture (OR 4.36  95% CI 1.35-14.05  P=0.01) and treatment for acute cellular rejection within 90 days after transplantation (OR 3.53  95% CI 1.03-12.15  P=0.05) were independent risk factors for IA. Antifungal prophylaxis was administered to 61% (57/93) of CF-LTRs. One-year mortality rate was 16% (15/93). IA was not associated with increased risk of death (OR 2.10  95% CI 0.62-7.06  P=0.23).                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Pretransplant Aspergillus colonization is frequent among CF-LTRs and a positive intraoperative Aspergillus culture produced a fourfold higher risk of developing IA.

The few documented cases in children have all resulted in deaths during hospitalisation. We present the case of a 12-year-old boy with CF who was admitted for an exacerbation which was unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. The findings on imaging raised concerns about a possible fungal infection. As a result  voriconazole therapy was started prior to his respiratory deterioration. He was later found to be ß-D glucan and Aspergillus Ag galactomannan positive confirming the suspicion for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Three months after diagnosis  he was discharged home under stable condition. Voriconazole was continued beyond discharge and resulted in improvement of respiratory symptoms. This underscores the importance of early treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with CF. Unfortunately  the patient died 6 months after diagnosis from a CF exacerbation. "

We also stress that the occurrence of such fungal infections should lead physicians to search for the corresponding single-gene inborn errors of immunity. Finally  we suggest that other fungal infections may also result from hitherto unknown inborn errors of immunity  at least in some patients with no known risk factors.                 Label=""RECENT FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":An increasing number of PIDs are being shown to underlie fungal infectious diseases in children and young adults. Inborn errors of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex (chronic granulomatous disease)  severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I confer a predisposition to invasive aspergillosis and candidiasis. More rarely  inborn errors of interferon-<U+03B3> immunity underlie endemic mycoses. Inborn errors of interleukin-17 immunity have recently been shown to underlie chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC)  while inborn errors of caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) immunity underlie deep dermatophytosis and invasive candidiasis.                 Label=""SUMMARY"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":CMC  invasive candidiasis  invasive aspergillosis  deep dermatophytosis  pneumocystosis  and endemic mycoses can all be caused by PIDs. Each type of infection is highly suggestive of a specific type of PID. In the absence of overt risk factors  single-gene inborn errors of immunity should be sought in children and young adults with these and other fungal diseases. "

There has been a great deal of scientific debate as to the effectiveness of antifungal prophylaxis in preventing infection in different patient groups and in which patients it is an appropriate management option. Deciding on an appropriate prophylaxis regimen for IFD is challenging as the incidence varies among different patient groups  due to the varied nature of their underlying haematological disease  and in different regions and centres. Attempts have been made to define risk factors and include them in treatment protocols. Impaired immune status of the patient  especially neutropenia  is a key risk factor for IFD and can sometimes be related to specific polymorphisms of genes controlling innate immunity. Risk factors also vary according to the type of fungal pathogen. Consequently  prophylaxis needs to be tailored to individual patient groups. Furthermore  the choice of antifungal agent for prophylaxis depends on the potential for drug-drug interactions with the patients' concomitant medications. Additional challenges are optimal timing of antifungal prophylaxis  when to change from prophylaxis to antifungal treatment and how to prevent recurrence of IFD. This article considers the use of antifungal prophylaxis for patients at risk of IFD in daily clinical practice  with clinical profiles that may be distinct from those covered by guidelines  and aims to provide practical advice for treatment of these patient groups.

There has been a decline in Candida infections but Aspergillus species predominate. Other mold pathogens including Fusarium  Scedosporium  and Zygomycetes also cause infections in lung transplant recipients. Furthermore  the widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis has prompted a delay in onset of Aspergillus infection in lung transplant recipients. Pulmonary parenchymal disease has become the most common manifestation of invasive aspergillosis. Among the risk factors pre- or posttransplant Aspergillus colonization is the most important risk factor reported in several retrospective studies. Recently posttransplant colonization has been implicated in the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Other factors that have been reported include preceding cytomegalovirus infections  hypogammaglobulinemia  and single-lung transplantation. The risk factors for other mold infections such as Scedosporium  Fusarium  and Zygomycetes are not well studied. The best antimold prophylaxis strategy and choice of drug remains to be elucidated.

The von HippelLindau protein (VHL) controls protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs)  regulates vascular repair  and improves tissue perfusion. Here  we studied the role of VHL in microvascular repair by orthotopically transplanting tracheas into mice with VHL haplodeficiency in Tie2 lineage cells. We showed that VHL haplodeficiency prolonged airway microvascular perfusion and promoted tissue blood flow through the production of the angiogenic factors  SDF-1 and angiopoietin 1. VHL-haplodeficient pulmonary endothelial cells exhibited increased angiogenic activity  resistance to serum deprivation-induced cell death  and enhanced microvascular repair. By contrast  in recipient mice with HIF-1a deficiency in Tie2 lineage cells  microvascular repair was significantly diminished and suggested that recipient-derived HIF-1a normally participates in the repair of alloimmune-mediated microvascular damage. To evaluate the translational impact of our findings  we compared VHL-haplodeficient mice with wild-type controls using a model of Aspergillus airway infection. In 83% of the VHL-haplodeficient recipients  Aspergillus fumigatus was noninvasive in contrast to 75% of wild-type mice in which the mold was deeply invasive. Our study demonstrated that stabilization of HIF-1a in angiogenic cells  through Tie2 cell VHL haplodeficiency  promoted airway microvascular regeneration and vascular normalization and thereby minimized tissue ischemia and hypoxia. By also mitigating the virulence of A. fumigatus  a common pathogen and itself a risk factor for the development of lung transplant rejection  the selective enhancement of HIF-1a expression has the prospect of offering several novel therapeutic effects to transplant recipients."

Label=""FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Currently available tools for the diagnosis of IFIs include traditional methods like histopathology  culture  and radiology  and newer antigen- and PCR-based diagnostic assays. Attempts have also been made to predict IFIs based on colonization or other factors  including genetic polymorphisms impacting IFI susceptibility in high-risk patients. Biopsy with histopathologic analysis is often not possible in patients suspected of pulmonary aspergillosis due to increased bleeding risk  and blood cultures for IC  IA  or other IFIs are hindered by poor sensitivity and slow turnaround time which delays diagnosis. Radiology is often used to predict IFI but suffers from inability to differentiate certain pathogens and does not generally provide certainty of IFI diagnosis. Newer antigen-based diagnostics for early diagnosis include the ß-glucan assay for IFIs  galactomannan assay for IA  and a recent variation on the traditional cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) test with a Lateral Flow Assay for invasive cryptococcosis. PCR-based diagnostics represent additional tools with high sensitivity for the rapid diagnosis of IFIs  although better standardization of these methods is still required for their routine clinical use.

EDTA blood and serum samples for circulating Aspergillus biomarkers  including galactomannan (GM)  were collected twice-weekly on a prospective basis from all study patients who were categorized according to international consensus criteria for defining invasive fungal disease (IFD). Of 278 patients recruited there were 44 probable IA cases and only one proven case. Moderate sensitivity and specificity  poor positive predictive value (50-80%)  but good negative predictive value (&gt;80-90%) were common to both PCR assays. Overall biomarker performance could be improved by combining positive results of either PCR assay with GM taken within a 12-d period.

However  the relationship between Aspergillus concentration in the air and probability of IA is not quantitatively known. In this study  this relationship was examined in a murine model of IA. Immunosuppressed Balb/c mice were exposed for 60 minutes at day 0 to an aerosol of A. fumigatus spores (Af293 strain). At day 10  IA was assessed in mice by quantitative culture of the lungs and galactomannan dosage. Fifteen separate nebulizations with varying spore concentrations were performed. Rates of IA ranged from 0% to 100% according to spore concentrations. The dose-response relationship between probability of infection and spore exposure was approximated using the exponential model and the more flexible beta-Poisson model. Prior distributions of the parameters of the models were proposed then updated with data in a Bayesian framework. Both models yielded close median dose-responses of the posterior distributions for the main parameter of the model  but with different dispersions  either when the exposure dose was the concentration in the nebulized suspension or was the estimated quantity of spores inhaled by a mouse during the experiment. The median quantity of inhaled spores that infected 50% of mice was estimated at 1.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(4) and 3.2<U+2009>×<U+2009>10(4) viable spores in the exponential and beta-Poisson models  respectively.

Potential approaches for enhancing the host immune system in the combat against Aspergillus include the administration of effector and regulatory cells (e.g.  granulocytes  antigen-specific T cells  natural killer cells  dendritic cells) as well as the administration of recombinant cytokines  interferons and growth factors (e.g.  interferon-<U+03B3> granulocyte- and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) and various vaccination strategies. Although promising results are reported on in vitro data and animal studies  current data are too limited to allow solid conclusions on the risk and the benefit of these strategies in the clinical setting. Therefore  the real challenge in the future is to perform appropriately designed and powered clinical trials. These require international  multi-center collaboration  but may ultimately improve the outcome in immunocompromised patients suffering from invasive aspergillosis."

Known risk factors are profound and long lasting neutropenia  uncontrolled graft versus host disease  continuous administration of steroids and environmental factors such as hospital construction. Numerous efforts have been undertaken for prophylaxis of invasive aspergillosis in high-risk populations. Most of them failed to demonstrate survival advantages. Prophylaxis makes sense  since diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis remain difficult. The introduction of non-culture based tools for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is an important step forward for early and sensitive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Early treatment is the cornerstone of a successful management of invasive aspergillosis. Substantial improvement came with the introduction of lipid formulations of amphotericin B in the early 1990s. Voriconazole was the first azole that improved the overall survival for patients with invasive aspergillosis. Newer azoles and the echinocandins were introduced for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in the late 1990s. Voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B allow a safer and more effective treatment of invasive aspergillosis when compared with amphotericin B-desoxycholate. Combination of antifungal agents has been introduced in clinical trials. Up to now no significant benefit has been obtained with antifungal combination compared to voriconazole alone. Because mortality of invasive aspergillosis remains up to more than 50%  prophylaxis  early diagnosis and early initiation of antifungal therapy are of utmost importance for the reduction of invasive aspergillosis related mortality. Despite all advances in the management of invasive aspergillosis important questions remain unresolved. This article reviews the current state and new insights in the management of invasive aspergillosis and points out clinicians unmet needs."

Mortality rate of this disease is still very high (50-95%)  partly because of diagnostic difficulties  limited antifungal treatment options  weak conditions of patients at risk; but also in part because understanding of virulence factors involved in A. fumigatus pathogenicity and interactions of the pathogen with the host immune system is still poor.

The murine hydrocortisone-mediated immunosuppression model of pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly used to characterise IFIs in these patients. However  this model does not take into account the effects of calcineurin inhibitors on transplant immunity to IFIs or the fungal calcineurin pathway  which is required for both virulence and antifungal drug resistance. To address these two issues  a new and clinically relevant transplant immunosuppression model of tacrolimus (FK506) and hydrocortisone-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was developed. We first characterised IFIs in 406 patients with a lung transplant. This showed that all of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis were immunosuppressed with calcineurin inhibitors and steroids. Murine pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that an ideal dose of 1 mg/kg/day of FK506 intraperitoneally produced blood trough levels in the human therapeutic range (5-12 ng/ml). There was increased mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in a transplant-relevant immunosuppression model using both FK506 and hydrocortisone as compared with immunosuppression using hydrocortisone only. Lung histopathology showed neutrophil invasion and tracheobronchitis that was associated with reduced lung tumour necrosis factor-a (TNFa)  JE (homologue of human MCP-1) and KC (homologue of human IL-8) at 24 hours  but increased lung TNFa  JE and KC at 48 hours when fungal burden was high. Furthermore  FK506 directly impaired fungal killing in alveolar macrophages in vitro  with FK506-mediated inhibition of the radial growth of Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro occurring at the low concentration of 5 ng/ml. Taken together  these findings show that the immunosuppressive activity of FK506 outweighs its antifungal activity in vivo. These observations demonstrate that FK506 impairs innate immune responses and leads to an incremental increase in susceptibility to IFIs when it is combined with steroids. This new and clinically relevant mouse model of invasive aspergillosis is a valuable addition to the further study of both fungal immunity and antifungal therapy in organ transplantation."

The main risk groups are patients with acute leukemia and bone marrow transplantation recipients. The lack of an early diagnostic test together with the limited spectrum of antifungal drugs remains a setback to the successful treatment of this disease. During invasive infection the inhaled fungal conidia enter the morphogenic cycle leading to angioinvasive hyphae. This work aimed to study differentially expressed proteins of A. fumigatus during morphogenesis. To achieve this goal  a 2D-DIGE approach was applied to study surface proteins extractable by reducing agents of two A. fumigatus morphotypes: germlings and hyphae. Sixty-three differentially expressed proteins were identified by MALDI-ToF/MS. We observed that proteins associated with biosynthetic pathways and proteins with multiple functions (miscellaneous) were over-expressed in the early stages of germination  while in hyphae  the most abundant proteins detected were related to metabolic processes or have unknown functions. Among the most interesting proteins regulated during morphogenesis  two putative drug targets were identified  the translational factor  eEF3 and the CipC-like protein.

Label=""RECENT FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Limited clinical studies suggest that an exposure-response relationship for posaconazole exists for the treatment of established invasive fungal diseases (IFDs)  with emerging but less compelling data supporting its role in prophylaxis. The high prevalence of subtherapeutic levels has not translated to high prophylactic failure rates perhaps because of preferential uptake by effector cells important in the front-line defence against Aspergillus species. Nevertheless  TDM would appear prudent in patients deemed at highest risk for IFD with correction of patient modifiable factors and attention to drug administration important in optimizing drug exposure. TDM performed within a few days after commencing posaconazole may be predictive of steady-state levels  thus minimizing the delay in obtaining results in addition to identifying a subset of patients who may remain persistently subtherapeutic and also resistant to dose-escalation. Trough levels may be supplanted by untimed levels at steady state  thereby expanding the practicalities of TDM. We propose that TDM becomes one of the several measures in an integrated approach to IFD prevention combining screening of high-risk haematology patients for invasive aspergillosis at presentation  together with prospective surveillance for IFD  explicit criteria for switching to an alternative prophylactic agent and adherence to infection control practices.

A continuous flow UV reactor which could be used as a point-of-use (POU) system was used to survey Aspergillus inactivation by UV irradiation. The inactivation efficiency of UV fluence (4.15-25 mJ/cm(2)) was measured by determination of fungal density in water before and after radiation. Because turbidity and iron concentration are two major water quality factors impacting UV disinfection effectiveness  the potential influence of these factors on UV inactivation of Aspergillus spp. was also measured. The 4 log inactivation for A. fumigatus  A. niger and A. flavus at a density of 1000 cfu/ml was achieved at UV fluences of 12.45 mJ/cm(2)  16.6 mJ/cm(2) and 20.75 mJ/cm(2)  respectively. The inactivation efficiency for lower density (100 cfu/ml) was the same as for the higher density except for A. flavus. The removal efficiency of Aspergillus spp. was decreased by increasing the turbidity and iron concentration.

PCZ has high interindividual variability with regard to its plasma drug trough concentrations (C(min)). Moreover  the concentration-efficiency relationship remains to be better characterized in prophylaxis. To determine the variability factors in plasma drug concentrations  the PCZ C(min) and clinical parameters (localization of GVHD  presence of diarrhea  and diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis) were collected retrospectively in 29 consecutive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients who developed GVHD and were receiving prophylactic PCZ (200 mg  3 times/day  for =7 days). Blood samples were analyzed at steady state to determine the PCZ C(min) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The average PCZ C(min) was 1.28 ± 0.82 mg/liter (mean ± standard deviation; n = 292 dosages)  with an intraindividual variability of 49% and an interindividual variability of 64%. Twenty percent of C(min)s were below 0.7 mg/liter  which is considered the threshold of efficacy by the Food and Drug Administration. The patients who had gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD experienced a 24% reduction in the posaconazole C(min)  compared with those with other localizations of GVHD. This decrease reached 33% when patients presented with diarrhea due to GI GVHD or an infectious etiology. PCZ C(min)s were 26% lower when invasive aspergillosis was declared. These data demonstrate that GI disturbances affect drug concentrations. Thus  therapeutic monitoring of PCZ can be used to detect low drug concentrations  possibly resulting in a lack of efficacy of invasive aspergillosis prophylaxis."

Our goal is to determine predictors of voriconazole-associated hepatotoxicity in lung transplant recipients. We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study of lung transplant recipients from 2006 to 2010 who received voriconazole therapy. We compared characteristics of patients who developed hepatotoxicity and those who did not. One hundred five lung transplant recipients received voriconazole. Hepatotoxicity occurred in 51% (54/105) of patients and lead to discontinuation in 34% (36/105). In univariate analysis  age less than 40 years  cystic fibrosis  use of azathioprine  history of liver disease and early initiation of voriconazole were associated with hepatotoxicity. In multivariable logistic regression analysis  perioperative initiation of voriconazole (within 30 days of transplantation) was independently associated with hepatotoxicity (OR 4.37  95% CI: 1.53-12.43  p = 0.006). The five risk factors identified in the univariate analysis were used to build a K-nearest neighbor algorithm predictive model for hepatotoxicity.

In this study  PPCs were analysed in a prospective  observational  single-centre study and the correlation of PPCs with breakthrough IMIs in patients with haematological malignancies was evaluated. Risk factors associated with low PPCs were further evaluated. A total of 109 PPCs were measured in 34 cases receiving PCZ prophylaxis (n=31) or treatment (n=3). Levels below the target of 0.5 µg/mL were detected in 24 (71%) of the 34 cases; in 15 (63%) of these 24 cases concentrations were found to be &lt;0.20 µg/mL. Three patients receiving PCZ prophylaxis met the criteria of breakthrough infection. Notably  prior to development of IMI  PPCs were below the target in all three individuals. Associated risk factors for insufficient PPCs varied from previous reports. In conclusion  these data demonstrate that therapeutic drug monitoring of PCZ is mandatory in all patients with haematological malignancies as low PPCs are common and may be associated with development of IMIs."

Although both compounds are readily recoverable from spiked human serum or plasma  only bmGT is retained in whole blood  indicating that bmGT may be the better marker for in vivo detection. Accordingly  bmGT was found more frequently than GT in samples from patients at risk of IA and incultures of clinical isolates of A. fumigatus. In some cases  bmGT was detected before mycologic evidence ofinfection was gained. Importantly  neither GT nor bmGT was found in serum from healthy donors or from neutropenic patients without any sign of infection. Thus  bmGT presence might provide a more reliable indicator of A. fumigatus infections than GT. Due to its simplicity and sensitivity  a diagnostic technology based on this test could be easily adopted in clinical laboratories to help in the diagnosis of this often fatal fungal infection."

They are associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate as well as high health care costs. An important increase in their incidence has been observed during the past two decades. In infants and children  invasive candidiasis is five times more frequent than invasive aspergillosis. Candida sp. represents the third most common agent found in healthcare-associated bloodstream infections in children. Invasive aspergillosis is more often associated with hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Recommendations concerning prophylactic treatment for invasive aspergillosis have been recently published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Candida albicans is the main Candida sp. associated with invasive candidiasis in children  even if a strong trend toward the emergence of Candida non-albicans has been observed. The epidemiology and the risk factors for invasive fungal infections are quite different if considering previously healthy children hospitalized in the pediatric intensive care unit  or children with a malignancy or a severe hematological disease (leukemia). In children  the mortality rate for invasive aspergillosis is 2.5 to 3.5 higher than for invasive candidiasis (respectively 70% vs. 20% and 30%)."

A shift in the distribution of Candida spp. from Candida albicans to non-albicans Candida spp. has been observed both in ICUs and oncology units in the last two decades. Timely diagnosis of IC remains a challenge despite the introduction of new microbiology techniques. Delayed initiation of antifungal therapy is associated with increased mortality. Therefore  prediction rules have been developed and validated prospectively in order to identify those ICU patients at high risk for IC and likely to benefit from early treatment. These rules  however  have not been validated in cancer patients. Similarly  major clinical studies on the efficacy of newer antifungals typically do not include cancer patients. Despite the introduction of more potent and less toxic antifungals  mortality from IFIs amongst cancer patients remains high.

Recent evidence has established a pivotal role for a danger sensing mechanism implicating the S100B/receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) axis in antifungal immunity. The association of selected genetic variants in the S100B/RAGE axis with susceptibility to IA was investigated in 223 consecutive patients undergoing HSCT. Furthermore  studies addressing the functional consequences of these variants were performed. Susceptibility to IA was significantly associated with two distinct polymorphisms in RAGE (-374T/A) and S100B (+427C/T) genes  the relative contribution of each depended on their presence in both transplantation counterparts [patient SNP(RAGE)  adjusted hazard ratio (HR)  1.97; P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.042 and donor SNP(RAGE)  HR  2.03; P<U+200A>=<U+200A>0.047] or in donors (SNP(S100B)  HR  3.15; P<U+200A>=<U+200A>7.8e-(4)) only  respectively. Functional assays demonstrated a gain-of-function phenotype of both variants  as shown by the enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines in RAGE polymorphic cells and increased S100B secretion in vitro and in vivo in the presence of the S100B polymorphism. These findings point to a relevant role of the danger sensing signaling in human antifungal immunity and highlight a possible contribution of a genetically-determined hyperfunction of the S100B/RAGE axis to susceptibility to IA in the HSCT setting."

The therapeutic goals are to restore leucocyte function and to reduce the fungal burden by effective antifungal agents and  contingently  by surgery. Several drugs for the treatment of IA are currently licensed. The longest known among them is amphotericin B (AmB). In well-performed clinical trials  approximately 30-50% of participants treated with AmB showed complete or partial response. However  this drug is associated with considerable acute and chronic toxicity which was somewhat mitigated by the development of lipid-based formulations. In contrast  voriconazole (VRC) is better tolerated  penetrates well into the central nervous system and may be given intravenously and orally in a sequential manner. The overall rates of favourable response to VRC were similar to that for AmB. Most notably  double-digit rates of complete remission were observed in studies including extraordinarily high proportions of patients with proven IA and specific risk factors. Disadvantages of VRC include the genetically determined interindividual variability of pharmacokinetics and the potential for drug-drug interactions that may require therapeutic drug monitoring. The recently introduced caspofungin (CPF) offers an excellent safety profile  but underperformed in terms of efficacy against mold infections. Other antifungals such as itraconazole and posaconazole are presently recommended as second-line option for the therapy or prophylaxis of (non-)IA. The value of micafungin and anidulafungin remains to be investigated in randomized clinical trials. In guidelines released by relevant medical societies  VRC is recommended as the first choice in the treatment of IA. AmB  preferably given as a liposomal preparation  or combinatory antifungal regimens combining VRC or liposomal AmB with CPF are stated as alternative options."

This raises the question of whether genetic risk prediction can be used to alter clinical practice. This review focuses on the current status of genetic association studies regarding invasive fungal disease among hematology patients  with an emphasis on IMD.                 Label=""RECENT FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Many studies have shown that SNPs in genes encoding cytokines  chemokines  and their receptors can increase the risk for IMD. Greater emphasis has recently been placed on SNPs in pattern-recognition receptors  including Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and dectin-1. An association has been found between SNPs in TLR4 and dectin-1 and invasive aspergillosis  which has been strengthened by biological evidence from in-vitro and in-vivo studies that showed a loss of function in the presence of the SNP. Nevertheless  despite improving our understanding of host antifungal defenses in immunocompromised hosts  clinical applicability is still a long way off. Current genetic associations need further validation  as virtually all studies suffer methodological limitations such as small sample size  heterogeneity of cohorts  selection bias  ill defined outcome measure  and statistical flaws  mainly the lack of adjustments for multiple comparisons.                 Label=""SUMMARY"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Genetic variations in immune genes are associated with the risk for IMD among hematology patients although inconsistencies are frequently reported. The next step will be to select consistent SNPs and test them for their value in assessing risk in larger  better designed multicenter studies that will necessitate collaboration of multiple institutions in national or international consortia.

However  it may constitute a risk factor for the development of opportunistic infections  such as invasive aspergillosis which is mainly caused by the most common airborne fungal pathogen A. fumigatus. moDC were generated in the presence or absence of RAD. In this setting  RAD had various modulating effects on the immune function of DC. A decrease of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12  TNF-a  CCL20  IL-10) was observed. Furthermore  RAD reduced the expression of innate immunity receptors (TLR2  TLR4  dectin-1)  impaired the maturation capacity of moDC observed through the reduction of costimulatory factors (CD40  CD80  CD83  CD86)  and impaired their capacity to phagocytose and damage A. fumigatus.

Amphotericin B was for more than 40 years the gold standard for almost all IFI  but toxicity and resistance  especially of new and emerging pathogens remained important issues. Fluconazole and itraconazole have also the same disadvantage of resistance. Voriconazole  a new triazole antifungal has offered an additional option  but the problem of resistant aspergillosis  and zygomycosis remains. Echinocandins (caspofungin  micafungin and anidulafungin) are active only against Candida and Aspergillus spp.  but not against Fusarium  Scedosporium and Zygomycetes. Posaconazole is the most recently approved triazole with broad spectrum activity against Candida spp.  Aspergillus spp.  Cryptococcus neoformans  Zygomycetes  dermatiaceous  dimorphic  and other fungal pathogens. Interestingly  posaconazole is active against Candida spp.  resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole  and Aspergillus fumigatus resistant to fluconazole itraconazole  amphotericin B  and voriconazole.

Here  we summarize in detail the current knowledge about genetic markers correlated with invasive aspergillosis and their relevance for the developing and outcome of infections with A. fumigatus."

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to acquire a wide mass spectral range and characterize the early process of asexual sporulation of lethal IA pathogens recovered on agar plates. Proteins were extracted using trifluoroacetic acid and soft ionized using an ultraviolet laser with the assistance of ferulic acid. At the second stage of sporulation with various differentiated structures  there are more specific peaks that can be used to discriminate different Aspergillus species than at the first stage  which features vegetative hyphae. Certain specific peaks are found in different strains of the same species  Aspergillus fumigatus. In addition  the relative standard deviations of the m/z ratios are much smaller than those of the relative intensities in these peaks. Therefore  common lethal Aspergillus species can be identified after short-term cultivation by matching species-specific m/z values."

Although mortality of invasive aspergillosis remains as high as 30-50%. Backbone of management are prophylaxis  early diagnosis and early initiation of antifungals for reduction of invasive aspergillosis related mortality. Randomized trials have been undertaken for the prophylaxis as well as treatment of invasive aspergillosis in the last two decades. Posaconazole is recommended for prophylaxis against aspergillosis in patients treated for acute myelogenous leukemia  myelodysplastic syndrome or patients with graft versus host disease after allogeneic transplantation. Efficacy has been shown for first-line therapy of invasive aspergillosis with voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B. Gastrointestinal resorption for the azoles posaconazole  voriconazole and itraconazole differ considerably. While oral voriconazole resportion is reduced when taken with food  posaconazole has to be taken with fatty food for optimal intestinal resorption. Beside all advances in the management of invasive aspergillosis important questions remain unresolved. This article reviews the current state of prophylaxis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis and points out clinicians unmet needs."

Difficulty in diagnosing invasive fungal infections in these patients complicates decisions regarding pharmacotherapy. Because of the difficult diagnosis and the significant morbidity and mortality of fungal infections in patients with neutropenia  systemic antifungal agents are used as empiric antifungal therapy in patients with febrile neutropenia who are not responding to antibacterial therapy. The pharmacotherapy of invasive fungal infections has evolved rapidly within the past several years as numerous antifungal agents--different formulations of amphotericin B  azoles  and echinocandins--have become available for use as empiric antifungal therapy in patients with febrile neutropenia. Various levels of evidence support the use of these agents for this indication. Their use is limited  however  by drug intolerance  drug interactions  adverse-event profiles  and limited activity with some mold species. Thus  considerations for selecting an antifungal drug for empiric use in patients with febrile neutropenia should include the epidemiology of fungal infections in the individual patient's institution and the specific clinical circumstances of the patient."

Although the overall incidence of fungal infections in liver transplant recipients has declined due to the early treatment of high-risk patients  the overall mortality rate remains high  particularly for invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis. IFIs after liver transplantation are strongly associated with negative outcomes  increasing the cost to recipients. Numerous studies have attempted to determine the independent risk factors related to IFIs and to reduce the morbidity and mortality with empirical antifungal prophylaxis after liver transplantation. Unfortunately  fungal infections are often diagnosed too late; symptoms can be mild and non-specific even with dissemination. Currently  no consensus exists on which patients should receive antifungal prophylaxis  when prophylaxis should be given  which antifungal agents should be used  and what duration is effective. This review highlights the types of IFI  risk factors  diagnosis  antifungal prophylaxis  and treatment after liver transplantation.

The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence and types of IFI  to determine risk factors for outcomes of IFI  and to assist in decision-making concerning the need for prophylactic strategies in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Data from a multi-institutional registry of 1854 patients transplanted between 01/93 and 12/04 were analyzed to determine risk factors and outcomes of children with IFI post-heart transplantation. One hundred and thirty-nine episodes of IFI occurred in 123 patients and made up 6.8% of the total number of post-transplant infections. IFI was most commonly attributed to yeast (66.2%)  followed by mold (15.8%) and Pneumocystis jiroveci (13%). Ninety percent of the yeast infections were caused by Candida spp.  and Aspergillus spp. was causative in 82% of the mold infections. There was a significantly increased risk of fungal infection associated with pretransplant invasive procedures (e.g.  ECMO  prior surgery  VAD  mechanical ventilation) with an incremental risk with increasing numbers of invasive procedures (early phase 0 vs. 1  RR 1.3; 0 vs. 3  RR 2.3; p&lt;0.001).

Forty-nine percent of recipients with IFI died  all within six months post-transplant. Invasive fungal infections are uncommon in pediatric heart transplant recipients. Risk and mortality are highest in the first six months post-transplant especially in patients with previous surgery and those requiring mechanical support. Prophylactic strategies for high-risk patients should be considered and warrants further study."

However there is increasing evidence that apparently immunocompetent patients  such as those with severe liver disease  are also at high risk for Aspergillus infections. Here we report two cases of proven invasive aspergillosis and review 72 others of aspergillosis reported since 1973 in patients with liver disease. Most patients had end-stage cirrhosis or acute hepatic failure. Overall mortality rate was 72.2% and the majority of patients who died had CNS involvement  disseminated infections  and received antifungal agents on a less common basis. A trend toward higher survival for cases reported during the period 2000-2009 was observed. Literature data suggest that invasive aspergillosis is a potential fatal complication of severe liver disease. The high mortality rate observed in these patients appears to be related not only to the severity of their underlying conditions  but also to a lack in clinical diagnosis. New diagnostic tools  e.g.  galactomannan (GM) antigen test  in association with increased clinical suspicion may allow an early diagnosis and improve the outcome of IA in this particular category of patients."

Data on IA in non-neutropenic patients are limited. The aim of this study was to establish the incidence  disease manifestations and outcome of IA in non-neutropenic patients diagnosed in five Swiss university hospitals during a 2-year period. Case identification was based on a comprehensive screening of hospital records. All cases of proven and probable IA were retrospectively analysed. Sixty-seven patients were analysed (median age 60 years; 76% male). Sixty-three per cent of cases were invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA)  and 17% of these were disseminated aspergillosis. The incidence of IPA was 1.2/10 000 admissions. Six of ten cases of extrapulmonary IA affected the brain. There were six cases of invasive rhinosinusitis  six cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis  and cases three of subacute pulmonary aspergillosis. The most frequent underlying condition of IA was corticosteroid treatment (57%)  followed by chronic lung disease (48%)  and intensive-care unit stays (43%). In 38% of patients with IPA  the diagnosis was established at autopsy. Old age was the only risk factor for post-mortem diagnosis  whereas previous solid organ transplantation and chronic lung disease were associated with lower odds of post-mortem diagnosis. The mortality rate was 57%."

It remains unclear why certain patients develop invasive aspergillosis while others  undergoing identical transplant regimen and similar post transplant immunosuppression  do not. Over the last decade  pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) have emerged as critical components of the innate immune system. By detecting specific molecular patterns from invading microbes and initiating inflammatory and subsequent adaptive immune responses  pattern recognition receptors are strategically located at the molecular interface of hosts and pathogens. Polymorphisms in pattern recognition receptors and downstream signaling molecules have been associated with increased or decreased susceptibility to infections  suggesting that their detection may have an increasing impact on the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases in the coming years. Infectious risk stratification may be particularly relevant for patients with hematologic malignancies  because of the high prevalence and severity of infections in this population. This review summarizes the innate immune mechanisms involved in Aspergillus fumigatus detection and the role of host genetic polymorphisms in susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis."

A PubMed/Medline literature search was performed for studies concerning IA reported during 1970 through March 2010 from these countries. IA is an important cause of morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients of developing countries  though the exact frequency of the disease is not known due to inadequate reporting and facilities to diagnose. Only a handful of centers from India  China  Thailand  Pakistan  Bangladesh  Sri Lanka  Malaysia  Iran  Iraq  Saudi Arabia  Egypt  Sudan  South Africa  Turkey  Hungary  Brazil  Chile  Colombia  and Argentina had reported case series of IA. As sub-optimum hospital care practice  hospital renovation work in the vicinity of immunocompromised patients  overuse or misuse of steroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics  use of contaminated infusion sets/fluid  and increase in intravenous drug abusers have been reported from those countries  it is expected to find a high rate of IA among patients with high risk  though hard data is missing in most situations. Besides classical risk factors for IA  liver failure  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  diabetes  and tuberculosis are the newly recognized underlying diseases associated with IA. In Asia  Africa and Middle East sino-orbital or cerebral aspergillosis  and Aspergillus endophthalmitis are emerging diseases and Aspergillus flavus is the predominant species isolated from these infections. The high frequency of A. flavus isolation from these patients may be due to higher prevalence of the fungus in the environment. Cerebral aspergillosis cases are largely due to an extension of the lesion from invasive Aspergillus sinusitis. The majority of the centers rely on conventional techniques including direct microscopy  histopathology  and culture to diagnose IA. Galactomannan  ß-D glucan test  and DNA detection in IA are available only in a few centers. Mortality of the patients with IA is very high due to delays in diagnosis and therapy. Antifungal use is largely restricted to amphotericin B deoxycholate and itraconazole  though other anti-Aspergillus antifungal agents are available in those countries. Clinicians are aware of good outcome after use of voriconazole/liposomal amphotericin B/caspofungin  but they are forced to use amphotericin B deoxycholate or itraconazole in public-sector hospitals due to economic reasons."

TNF acts through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) triggering a pro-inflammatory response  and therefore plays a pivotal role in immune regulation and host immune responses. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFR1 gene may influence the innate immune response against Aspergillus. Three SNPs were genotyped in 275 individuals (144 immunocompromised haematological patients with high-risk of developing IPA and 131 healthy controls): TNFR1(-383(A/C)) (rs2234649) and TNFR1(-609(G/T)) (rs4149570) in the 5 prime UTR region  and TNFR1(+36(A/G)) SNP (rs767455) in the first exon of the gene. Of the 144 haematological patients  77 patients developed Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) infection and the remaining 67 patients were not infected. TNFR1(+36(A/G)) and TNFR1(-609(G/T)) were associated with IPA susceptibility (p=0.033 and p=0.018  respectively). A role of TNFR1 genetic variants in the susceptibility of patients to develop IPA was also supported by the significantly lower TNFR1 mRNA expression level in IPA than in IPA-resistant patients and the strong correlation between the TNFR1(-609) genetic variant and the expression levels of TNFR1. There was also a tendency for a higher frequency of galactomannan (GM) positivity in patients with TNFR1(-609G/G) genotype than in patients with TNFR1(-609G/T) (p=0.0909) or TNFR1(-609T/T) (p=0.0913) genotype. Predictive sequence analysis of the effects of TNFR1(-609) promoter polymorphism revealed that this SNP might play a critical role in modifying the affinity of ICSBP/IRF-8  a transcription factor that is involved in the TNFR1-mediated activation of NFkappaB signalling pathway. Taken together  these data suggest that TNFR1 polymorphisms influence the risk of IPA disease and might be useful for risk stratification strategies. These findings need to be confirmed in validation studies with larger samples of haematological patients."

Thirteen patients had acute leukaemia. Nine were allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. Clinical symptoms and imaging were poorly specific. The galactomannan antigenaemia test result was positive in 16/25 (64%) patients  including in four of the eight cases of isolated gut aspergillosis. Five of 21 patients had a dietary regimen rich in spices  suggesting that  in these cases  food could have been the source of gut colonization  and then of a primary gut Aspergillus lesion. The diagnosis was made post-mortem in six patients. The mortality rate in the remaining patients at 12 weeks was 7/15 (47%). Gut aspergillosis is probably misdiagnosed and underestimated in haematology patients  owing to the poor specificity of symptoms and imaging.

Additional risk factors in stem cell transplant recipients include impaired lymphocyte engraftment and graft-versus-host disease. Pediatric invasive aspergillosis is associated with a high mortality rate (generally &gt;50%) and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent dissemination and death. Tools available for diagnosis include radiologic examinations (primarily computed tomography)  the galactomannan assay  bronchoalveolar lavage  and tissue biopsy. Age-related differences in computed tomography and galactomannan assay results have been suggested. Recommended primary therapy for pediatric invasive aspergillosis is voriconazole (7 mg/kg IV q12 hours). Currently approved alternative therapies include liposomal amphotericin B  amphotericin B lipid complex  and caspofungin. Posaconazole and itraconazole are also possibilities  but there is no established pediatric dose for posaconazole  and itraconazole dosing is difficult in children.

Susceptibility to fungal infections and the course of GvHD can be genetically influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  which regulate expression or biological activity of chemokines  and therefore have an impact on the outcome of invasive aspergillosis and GvHD.

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the toxicity and the impact of aerosolized deoxycholate amphotericin B (aero-d-AmB) on respiratory tract IFIs (airways IFIs) in a homogeneous cohort of allogeneic HSCT patients  transplanted at one institution. Since 1999  102 consecutive patients were transplanted from matched related (N = 71) or unrelated donor (MUD). Aero-d-AmB was administered for a median time of 16 days (range 2-45)  in addition to systemic antifungal prophylaxis. Prolonged administration was neither associated with increased severe bacterial infections  nor with severe adverse events. In 16 patients in whom aero-d-AmB was delivered for less than 8 days  due to worsened clinical conditions or poor compliance  proven or probable airways IFIs were diagnosed in three cases (one mucormycosis and one fusariosis and one probable aspergillosis)  whereas in 84 patients receiving aero-d-AmB for = 8 days  one possible and one probable aspergillosis were diagnosed. A shortened administration (&lt; 8 days) of aero-d-AmB was therefore associated with an increased risk of both total airways IFIs (P = 0.027) and proven/probable IFIs (P = 0.012). At multivariate analysis prolonged aero-d-AmB administration retained an independent protective effect on airways IFIs (P = 0.026) whereas a MUD transplant was associated with a borderline increase of IFIs risk (P=0.052). Overall  95.1% of patients did not experience airways IFIs and no patient died due to IFIs. In this cohort of patients  prolonged aero-d-AmB seems to have a role in preventing respiratory tract IFIs  but a randomized controlled trial is recommended to verify the impact of this prophylaxis in the setting of allogeneic HSCT."

The initial predominance of CANDIDA species has given way to the prominence of ASPERGILLUS species in the current era followed by other mold infections  namely  SCEDOSPORIUM and Zygomycetes  which are emerging as newer pathogens. CRYPTOCOCCUS NEOFORMANS is another important pathogen responsible for the morbidity in lung transplant recipients. The use of widespread antifungal prophylaxis directed against the mold infections has resulted in delayed onset of invasive aspergillosis in lung transplant recipients. In recent studies cumulative incidence rate of invasive aspergillosis was noted to be 2.4% at 12 months. Invasive mold infections in lung transplant may present as tracheobronchitis  invasive pulmonary infections  or disseminated disease. Invasive pulmonary infections are now the most common manifestations of mold infections  followed by tracheobronchitis. Pre- or posttransplant ASPERGILLUS colonization  along with preceding cytomegalovirus infections  hypogammaglobulinemia  and single-lung transplants are considered significant risk factors for invasive aspergillosis. Recently posttransplant colonization has been implicated in the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. The appropriate antimold prophylaxis strategy  by the use of either voriconazole or inhaled amphotericin  remains to be fully determined. Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis have resulted in significant decreases in mortality. The risk factors for other mold infections such as SCEDOSPORIUM or Zygomycetes are being elucidated. Infections with these organisms  however  carry mortality up to 80%.

They can range widely in severity and can be life threatening in some patients. Candida and Aspergillus species are the most common causes of IFIs  but other yeasts and filamentous fungi are emerging pathogens. C. albicans  the most significant pathogenic species  is seen in almost all of the 17% of patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) who develop IFIs  and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Non-albicans spp. are becoming more common  particularly in neutropenic patients and those on existing azole therapy. Early diagnosis is challenging due to delays in  and low sensitivity of  confirmatory blood cultures  and difficulty in discriminating colonization from invasive candidiasis. Once diagnosed  early initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy is essential for reducing morbidity and mortality. Amphotericin B deoxycholate and azoles  once standard therapy  have been largely superseded in the ICU by broad-spectrum azoles  liposomal amphotericin B and the newer echinocandin agents with improved efficacy/tolerability profiles. The echinocandins (caspofungin  micafungin and anidulafungin) exhibit fungicidal activity against Candida spp. and fungistatic activity against Aspergillus spp. Echinocandins have demonstrated clinical efficacy  broad spectrum of activity and favourable pharmacological properties  and are  therefore  likely to replace fluconazole as the initial antifungal agent of choice among critically ill patients. Current evidence supports echinocandin empirical therapy for candidaemia or invasive candidiasis in ICU patients with or without neutropenia  and as rescue therapy in patients with life-threatening IFIs caused by strains resistant to other antifungals.

In a population with low incidence of IA  the use of these assays as a screening device on blood may not further enhance current outcomes. "

The mortality rate attributable to invasive aspergillosis was 27%  confirming previous reports of a downward trend in this rate. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the stage of acute myeloid leukemia and the duration of  and recovery from  neutropenia were independent prognostic factors. We analyzed outcomes after treatment with the three most frequently used drugs (liposomal amphotericin B  caspofungin  voriconazole). No differences emerged in survival at day 120 or in the overall response rate which was 71%  ranging from 61% with caspofungin to 84% with voriconazole.

The use of voriconazole for the treatment of aspergillosis and  less frequently  the use of echinocandins as empirical treatment for invasive fungal infections are thought to be responsible for the increase. In addition  an increased incidence of this infection has been observed in transplant recipients  including both haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT) patients. There are no global surveys on the prevalence or incidence of zygomycosis  but data from individual institutions and countries show that zygomycosis is an emerging infection. The increased incidence of zygomycosis most probably reflects a greater frequency of predisposing factors  such as higher numbers of patients undergoing HSCT and immunosuppressive chemotherapy. In addition  the emergence of rare pathogens as a result of the rise in the use of antifungal therapy against common species can be postulated. Further  the availability of antifungal agents with activity profiles that are more specific for selected fungi increases the necessity of identifying pathogenic fungi; the frequency of Zygomycetes infections may have been underestimated until now because therapeutic decisions did not depend on the precise identification of pathogenic fungi."

This class of fungi encompasses two orders  i.e. the Mucorales and the Entomophthorales. Members of the latter are associated with chronic cutaneous and subcutaneous infections that are limited to the tropics and rarely disseminate to internal organs. The order Mucorales includes several species involved in rhinocerebral  pulmonary  cutaneous  gastrointestinal and other less frequent infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals  and is characterized by a tendency to disseminate. Portals of entry of zygomycetes are usually the lungs  skin  and gastrointestinal tract. A characteristic property of zygomycetes is their tendency to invade blood vessels and to cause thrombosis-processes that result in subsequent necrosis of involved tissues. Risk factors associated with zygomycosis include prolonged neutropenia and use of corticosteroids  solid organ or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation  AIDS  poorly controlled diabetes mellitus  iron chelation with deferoxamine  burns  wounds  malnutrition  extremes of age  and intravenous drug abuse. Recently  the widespread use of voriconazole for prophylaxis or treatment of aspergillosis in patients with haematological malignancies has been linked with a rise in the numbers of cases of invasive zygomycosis. As the symptoms  clinical signs and imaging findings of these infections are non-specific  a high index of suspicion is required for timely diagnosis. Early diagnosis  correction of the underlying predisposing factors  aggressive surgical debridement of all infected tissues and lengthy administration of antifungals are the only potentially curative options for this rare but emerging invasive fungal infection."

Several of these non-albicans spp. (e.g.  C. glabrata and C. krusei ) exhibit resistance to traditional triazole antifungals like fluconazole  and cross-resistance with newer triazoles  focusing attention on the first-line use of antifungals such as the echinocandins  which possess improved activity against fluconazole-resistant strains. Recent treatment guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend an echinocandin as primary therapy for nonneutropenic or neutropenic patients with moderately severe to severe candidiasis and for patients at risk for infection with a triazole-resistant strain. However  further improvement in candidemia-associated mortality will only be attainable with the development and validation of new diagnostic tools that will allow earlier detection  discrimination  and treatment of invasive candidiasis.

Aspergillus colonization was defined as a positive culture from bronchoalveolar lavage or two sputum cultures positive for the same Aspergillus species  in the absence of invasive pulmonary Aspergillosis. We found that Aspergillus colonization was strongly associated with BOS and BOS related mortality in Cox regression analyses. Aspergillus colonization typically preceded the development of BOS by a median of 261 days (95% CI 87-520). Furthermore  in a multivariate Cox regression model  Aspergillus colonization was a distinct risk factor for BOS  independent of acute rejection. These data suggest a potential causative role for Aspergillus colonization in the development of BOS post-lung transplantation and raise the possibility that strategies aimed to prevent Aspergillus colonization may help delay or reduce the incidence of BOS."

Twelve cases of IFI patients were identified in SLE patients (6 Aspergillus spp.; 5 Cryptococcus spp.; 1 Candida spp.). The incidence of IFI was significantly higher in patients with SLE than RA (1.04 vs. 0.15%). Among 12 patients with SLE  10 had high Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores (&gt;or=8). The most commonly involved organ was the lung (n = 6)  followed by the meninges (n = 4). Most of SLE patients with IFI (91.7%) had taken steroids prior to IFI. Three SLE patients resulted in death. Notably  these patients were all infected with Aspergillus spp. The mortality was associated with the presence of leukopenia  high anti-DNA antibodies and high SLEDAI. Collectively  IFI is more common in patients with SLE than in patients with RA. High disease activity in patients with SLE might contribute to increased risk of IFI.

During induction therapy  he developed severe pneumonia. Although meropenem and micafungin were started  he died of circulatory failure owing to massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Autopsy specimens obtained from the stomach revealed fungal hyphae  which had invaded diffusely into submucosal vessels and caused the massive gastric bleeding. The same hyphae were also observed in both lungs. A diagnosis of disseminated zygomycosis was confirmed by its characteristic histopathological findings. Because zygomycetes are spontaneously resistant to the newer antifungal agents  such as voriconazole or micafungin  it seems likely that the prevalence of zygomycosis as a breakthrough infection may increase in the future. Zygomycosis is a rare  but life-threatening  deep fungal infection that appears in immunologically or metabolically compromised hosts. Its manifestations are clinically similar to those of invasive aspergillosis. In addition to the well-established epidemiology of zygomycosis  this case suggests the following new characteristics. (1) Although the gastrointestinal manifestation of zygomycosis is relatively rare  it is observed more frequently than invasive aspergillosis. (2) Gastrointestinal zygomycosis occasionally leads to the development of necrotic ulcers and may induce hemorrhagic shock.(3) We should be cautious of an occurrence of breakthrough zygomycosis when we use echinocandins for patients with known risk factors  especially steroid use and neutropenia.

It is important to realize that the timing and spectrum of risk for invasive aspergillosis have expanded. While patients with hematological malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplants make up the highest risk groups  patients such as those receiving steroids and other immunosuppressive therapies are also at risk. Non-culture-based methods (including galactomannan  1 3-beta-D-glucan  and PCR-based methods) are actively being pursued to improve early diagnosis.

The influence of steroids  one of the main risk factors for developing IPA  was also investigated. Quantification of mRNAs of the inflammatory mediator genes encoding interleukin (IL)-8  tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was carried out using real-time PCR. Ingestion rates were studied for the conidia of A. fumigatus and Penicillium chrysogenum using a fluorescence brightener. Similar results were obtained for both species  with ingestion rates ranging from 35 to 40 %. Exposure of A549 cells to live A. fumigatus conidia only induced a four- to fivefold increase in the mRNA levels of the three genes  starting 8 h after the initial contact. Both inactivation of live A. fumigatus conidia and treatment by dexamethasone (10(-7) M) prevented the overexpression of TNF-alpha  IL-8 and GM-CSF. Fungal growth  rather than conidia ingestion  appears to be the main stimulus for the production of inflammatory mediators by epithelial cells  and this production is inhibited by steroid therapy. These results underline the role that the epithelium plays in the innate response against IPA."

Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Two hundred thirty-four adult HSCT recipients with a total of 250 IFIs were included in this study. IA (59.2%) was the most frequent IFI  followed by invasive candidiasis (24.8%)  zygomycosis (7.2%)  and IFI due to other molds (6.8%). Voriconazole was the most frequently administered agent (68.4%); amphotericin B deoxycholate was administered to a few patients (2.1%). Ninety-three (46.7%) of 199 HSCT recipients with known outcome had died by week 12. The 6-week survival rate was significantly greater for patients with IA than for those with invasive candidiasis and for those with IFI due to the Zygomycetes or other molds (P &lt; .07). The 6-week mortality rate for HSCT recipients with IA was 21.5%. At 6 weeks  there was a trend toward a worse outcome among allogeneic HSCT recipients with IA who received myeloablative conditioning (P = .07); absence of mechanical ventilation or/and hemodialysis (P = .01) were associated with improved survival.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":IA remains the most commonly identified IFI among HSCT recipients  but rates of survival in persons with IA appear to have improved  compared with previously reported data.

Therefore  effective and correct prophylaxis of these IFIs continues to be an important issue in these patient populations. Fungal infections in the lung are most often due to Aspergillus spp.  but other non-Aspergillus moulds such as Mucor spp. can also cause pulmonary infections. Lung transplant recipients have the highest incidence of invasive aspergillosis of all SOT patients. Prophylaxis should consider the risk factors affecting each group of patients. As the lung is the target organ of most fungal infections due to moulds  aerosolised antifungal prophylaxis has been potentially considered to be a safe and effective strategy. Administration of a nebulised antibiotic achieves high local concentration of the drug  avoiding undesirable systemic effects and drug interactions. The use of aerosolised amphotericin B (AmB) as prophylaxis or co-adjuvant treatment for pulmonary fungal infections has been reported in several groups of immunosuppressed patients. Lipid formulations of AmB penetrate the lung better and have a longer half-life than amphotericin B deoxycholate (ABD). Prophylaxis with aerosolised lipid-based AmB products has several advantages over ABD: it can be administered at much longer intervals and is equally effective and better tolerated. Although several studies have been published using aerosolised AmB both as deoxycholate and lipid formulations  available data remain inconclusive owing a lack of standardisation of administration procedures and doses."

"588","Patients at high risk of invasive fungal infections: when and how to treat.","Rüping, MJ","18778118",2008,"10.2165/00003495-200868140-00002","Drugs","eng","New Zealand","When and how to treat invasive fungal infections (IFIs) is discussed in this review  with a focus on the two most prevalent non-endemic IFIs  namely invasive aspergillosis and invasive candidiasis. Early treatment initiation in patients with IFIs has a profound impact on mortality rates  but reliable diagnostic measures are lacking. This situation has led to the parallel use of different treatment strategies  e.g. prophylaxis  empirical and pre-emptive treatment  as well as targeted treatment in response to a definite diagnosis of IFI. Identifying high-risk patients is the first step in reducing IFI-related mortality. Patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis comprise (i) those with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) during remission induction chemotherapy; (ii) patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); (iii) recipients of solid organ transplants; and (iv) those with other conditions of severe and prolonged immunosuppression. Patients at high risk of invasive candidiasis are less well defined. Risk factors are diverse and include haematological malignancy  neutropenia  age &lt;1 month or &gt;65 years  and recent abdominal surgery. The individual risk further depends on the presence of a variety of other risk factors  including central venous catheters  use of broad spectrum antibacterials  prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay  total parenteral nutrition  mucosal Candida spp. colonization and renal failure.Extensive research has been conducted to facilitate the best possible treatment strategies for these severe infections. Optimal timing and choice of antifungal agents largely remain a matter of controversy. After having reviewed the major clinical trials  we conclude that comparisons between different treatment strategies cannot be made  neither at present nor in the near future. The complexity of the clinical problem leads to an eclectic treatment approach to reduce morbidity and mortality from IFIs without compromising tolerability. We recommend prophylaxis with posaconazole for allogeneic HSCT recipients  patients receiving induction chemotherapy for AML or MDS  and those undergoing immunosuppressive therapy for graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic HSCT. For the empirical treatment of persistently febrile neutropenia  caspofungin is our first- and liposomal amphotericin B deoxycholate (LAmB) our second-line choice. Once a diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis has been established  voriconazole should be the preferred treatment option  with LAmB being an alternative. Fluconazole prophylaxis for invasive candidiasis should remain restricted to high-risk ICU patients. Once a diagnosis has been established  the drug of choice for adequate treatment depends largely on neutrophil count and haemodynamic stability. In non-neutropenic patients  an echinocandin should be considered the first-line treatment option  while patients with susceptible Candida spp. may be switched to fluconazole. In neutropenic patients  caspofungin or micafungin might be preferred to anidulafungin as first-line treatment. LAmB is a second-line treatment option in both settings.Early diagnosis of IFIs is imperative to facilitate treatment success. In all patients at risk for IFIs  blood cultures  galactomannan antigen and diagnostic imaging should be rigorously enforced."

BG is present in the cell wall of most pathogenic fungi (including Pneumocystis jiroveci) in significant amounts with some notable exceptions such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Zygomycetes. Commercially available assays can detect serum BG concentrations as low as 1 pg/mL. Published validation studies have included patients with IA and other invasive fungal diseases (IFD). BG detection appears to be more sensitive than galactomannan detection in patients with IA  but BG's intrinsic lack of mycological specificity requires the integration of clinical  radiological  and microbiological data for proper interpretation. BG assay test characteristics can be used  for example  to exclude IA in some clinical scenarios  to increase the certainty of IA in the presence of an isolated positive galactomannan result or when testing follows initiation of antifungal treatment. BG may be falsely elevated in the serum in the absence of IFD in patients undergoing hemodialysis with cellulose membranes  in patients treated with immunoglobulin  albumin  or other blood products filtered through cellulose filters containing BG  and in patients with serosal exposure to glucan-containing gauze or to certain intravenous antimicrobials. These potential sources of false positivity should be considered when interpreting BG results. BG may be useful as a sensitive screening tool for surveillance of IA and other IFD in populations at risk. Stratified IFD screening and diagnostic strategies using both galactomannan and BG should be explored. Factors affecting the production and clearance of BG during IA and other IFD need additional study to further refine its diagnostic utility."

Label=""DATA SYNTHESIS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Posaconazole is an oral broad-spectrum triazole with activity against many yeasts and molds. Resistance to posaconazole has been reported  but has been rare to date. Posaconazole  in doses of 200 mg 3 times daily  reduced breakthrough invasive fungal infections (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.71) and aspergillosis incidence (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.75) in patients receiving hematopoietic stem-cell transplants compared with those receiving fluconazole. Similarly  the same regimen of posaconazole reduced invasive fungal infections (95% CI -9.7 to -2.5) and aspergillosis (CI not reported  p &lt; 0.001) when compared with fluconazole and itraconazole in neutropenic patients. Posaconazole is noninferior to fluconazole for treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis (95% CI -6.6 to 5.0)  but necessity for this indication remains unclear  as many other treatment options exist. Smaller investigations have analyzed use of posaconazole for patients requiring salvage or alternative treatment for zygomycosis  fusariosis  cryptococcal meningitis  coccidioidomycosis  and histoplasmosis. Studies are needed to clarify efficacy for such expanded use  and therapeutic drug monitoring may improve outcomes. The most common adverse effects associated with the use of posaconazole include headache  fever  nausea  vomiting  and diarrhea.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Posaconazole appears to be a valuable and promising addition to the antifungal armamentarium for prophylaxis and treatment of various fungal processes. At this time  posaconazole should probably be reserved for prophylaxis in patients at high risk for invasive fungal infection  as salvage therapy in refractory or resistant infections  or for patients with intolerance to other therapies.

Allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients are at a significantly greater risk for fungal infection than recipients of autologous transplantation. Although with the wide use of fluconazole prophylaxis the incidence and associated mortality of invasive candidiasis has been minimized  mold diseases remain a significant complication during periods of prolonged immunosuppression for graft versus host disease. Posaconazole prophylaxis during periods of high risk was recently demonstrated to be effective in preventing fungal infections and associated mortality. Preemptive strategy employing laboratory markers and serial CT scans to identify mold infection at an early stage is promising. However its efficacy has to be validated in clinical trials. Several new antifungal agents have been introduced lately  characterized by improved safety profile and broader antifungal spectrum. Voriconazole has become the standard of care for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. Finally there has been increasing interest on combination therapy for invasive aspergillosis due to the high rate of failure of the currently available antifungals  especially in the profoundly immunocompromised host."

The occurrence varies by type of transplantation  with aspergillosis more frequently associated with heart  liver and lung transplantation cases than those involving kidney recipients. Several risk factors have been proposed  with cases occurring early and late after the transplantation. Although pulmonary involvement is the main presentation  invasive extrapulmonary aspergillosis can on rare occasions be observed and is associated with poor prognosis. Herein  we report two cases that presented with extrapulmonary invasive aspergillosis  i.e.  one presented with cerebral abscess and the second with soft tissue abscess in the right posterior thigh. While the cerebral abscess was not surgically treated  the soft tissue abscess was surgically drained. When the primary focus was investigated  pulmonary nodulars were found in both cases. Both patients were treated with long-term amphotericin B; however  one patient was lost with functioning graft and the kidney of the second patient failed due to decreased immunosuppression and he died while on maintenance hemodialysis.

A number of environmental and epidemiologic risk factors for developing IA have been identified. However  genetic factors that affect risk for developing IA have not been clearly identified. We report that host genetic differences influence outcome following establishment of pulmonary aspergillosis in an exogenously immune suppressed mouse model. Computational haplotype-based genetic analysis indicated that genetic variation within the biologically plausible positional candidate gene plasminogen (Plg; Gene ID 18855) correlated with murine outcome. There was a single nonsynonymous coding change (Gly110Ser) where the minor allele was found in all of the susceptible strains  but not in the resistant strains. A nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (Asp472Asn) was also identified in the human homolog (PLG; Gene ID 5340). An association study within a cohort of 236 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients revealed that alleles at this SNP significantly affected the risk of developing IA after HSCT. Furthermore  we demonstrated that plasminogen directly binds to Aspergillus fumigatus. We propose that genetic variation within the plasminogen pathway influences the pathogenesis of this invasive fungal infection."

However  zygomycosis has also been reported in individuals without known risk factors. The causative fungi are members of the order Mucorales and individual species within this group require a high level of laboratory skill for their identification. These organisms are resistant to voriconazole and also to the echinocandins  and although zygomycosis is less commonly documented than invasive aspergillosis in leukaemic and HSCT patients  there are recent reports suggesting that it has increased in incidence since the introduction of voriconazole.

The management of cases is based on early diagnosis  surgical debridement when possible and aggressive antifungal therapy. Based on clinical experience  but without the benefit of comparative studies  liposomal amphotericin B has become the therapeutic agent of choice. Posaconazole is a new orally administered triazole antifungal and the first member of this class to have comparable in vitro activity to amphotericin B against most zygomycetes.

Diagnosis of IA has been difficult and often delayed and treatment outcome has been poor  with mortality rates up to 80%. This review summarizes recent developments in this field. There are indications that the incidence of IA may be decreasing due to multiple factors including better understanding of pathogenesis of IA  earlier diagnosis  and various prophylactic and preventive strategies. Recently posaconazole has shown to be effective in reducing the risk of IA in patients treated for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Early use of high-resolution thoracic computed tomography assisted with complimentary methods including bronchoalveolar lavage and serum galactomannan determinations are useful in early diagnosis. Our treatment armamentarium against IA has broadened significantly during the last years and there are some indications of improved outcome more recently. On the other hand  increasing use of blood progenitor grafts instead of marrow with higher risk of chronic GVHD  increasing age of SCT recipients  and wide use of donor lymphocyte infusions for treatment of minimal residual disease or relapse may affect to the opposite direction. Despite some promises and improvements  IA will continue to remain a challenge in the upcoming years."

Overall  91% of the sites employed antifungal prophylaxis; 28% used universal prophylaxis and 72% targeted it toward high-risk patients. Fluconazole was the most commonly used agent for universal and targeted prophylaxis. The leading choice for mold-active agents for antifungal prophylaxis was the echinocandins. Combination therapy was used as primary therapy for invasive aspergillosis in 47%  and as salvage in 80%. Thus  a vast majority of the surveyed programs employ antifungal prophylaxis and most use targeted prophylaxis. Consideration of these practices could guide clinical trial design to optimize antifungal prophylaxis in these patients. Our findings also merit investigations to better define the role of diagnostic assays and combination therapeutic strategies for invasive aspergillosis in liver transplant recipients."

The major autopsy findings and the cause of death were characterized and compared between those seen in allogeneic and those in autologous HSCT recipients. The study period preceded the use of prophylactic antifungal agents.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":A total of 66 autopsies were identified; 52 (79%) received allogeneic and 14 (21%) autologous transplantation. Death occurred at a median of 85 days post transplantation (range 2-1825 days); 36 (55%) died within the first 100 days post stem cells infusion. The major complications for HSCT patients were pulmonary  including diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)  acute pneumonia and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The most common cause of death in the allogeneic HSCT group was DAD (13/52; 25%)  followed by invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (10/52; 19%)  acute pneumonia (10/52; 19%) and massive gastrointestinal bleeding (6/52; 12%); in the autologous group causes were disease relapse/progression of the underlying malignancy (4/14; 29%)  acute pneumonia (3/14; 21%) and DAD (2/14; 14%).

The increased infectious complications observed in the allogeneic transplant cases may be explained by immunosuppression and that the study period preceded the use of prophylactic antifungal agents. However  relapse/progression of the disease is the predominant cause of mortality after autologous transplant. "

We report our results on a cohort of 125 patients treated homogenously who received a 6/6 matched sibling NMA HSCT designed to be performed on an outpatient basis. Conditioning regimen included fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) x 5 days) and cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m(2) x 5 days) followed by reinfusion of a minimum of 4 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Overall  13 patients developed IA (5 proved  6 probable  2 possible) 44-791 days (median 229) after NMA HSCT  with a risk of 7% at 1  11% at 2  and 15% at 3 years. Patients who suffered from IA had poorer overall survival (crude hazard ratio 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-5.4; P = .045).

After multivariate analysis  intestinal GVHD remained the only statistically significant risk factor for IA at 1 (P = .003)  2 (P = .01)  and 3 years (P = .005). We conclude that in NMA HSCT  the risk of IA increases over time and is significantly associated with intestinal GVHD.

A retrospective study of 362 consecutive lung transplant patients from a single national centre who were transplanted 1992-2003 were studied. Twenty-seven patients were excluded due to incomplete or missing files. A total of 105/335 (31%) patients had evidence of Aspergillus infection (colonisation or invasion)  including 83 (25%) patients with colonisation and 22 (6%) patients with radiographic or histological evidence of invasive disease.

Risk factors such as indwelling venous catheters or chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage are associated with an increased incidence of Gram-positive infections. Invasive fungal infections  particularly invasive aspergillosis  have become most important in severely neutropenic patients and are associated with fatality rates of 40-60%. The use of nucleoside analogues and the CD52-antibody alemtuzumab induce a long-lasting lymphopenia facilitating the occurrence of opportunistic infections specifically caused by viruses and fungi. In elderly patients undergoing intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy  infectious complications may be managed as successfully as in younger patients by appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The broad use of fluoroquinolones for antibacterial prophylaxis in neutropenic patients may lead to very high resistance rates among Gram-negative bacilli such as E. coli.

This is because of the higher number of patients with malignancies treated with intensive immunosuppressive therapy regimens as well as their improved survival from formerly fatal bacterial infections  and the rising number of patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell or organ transplantation. Early initiation of effective systemic antifungal treatment is essential for a successful clinical outcome in these patients; however  clinical clues for diagnosis are sparse and early microbiological proof of invasive aspergillosis (IA) is rare. Clinical diagnosis is based on pulmonary CT scan findings and non-culture based diagnostic techniques such as galactomannan or DNA detection in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Most promising outcomes can be expected in patients at high risk for aspergillosis in whom antifungal treatment has been started pre-emptively  backed up by laboratory and imaging findings. The gold standard of systemic antifungal treatment is voriconazole  which has been proven to be significantly superior to conventional amphotericin B and has led to a profound improvement of survival rates in patients with cerebral aspergillosis. Liposomal amphotericin B at standard dosages appears to be a suitable alternative for primary treatment  while caspofungin  amphotericin B lipid complex or posaconazole have shown partial or complete response in patients who had been refractory to or intolerant of primary antifungal therapy. Combination therapy with two antifungal compounds may be a promising future strategy for first-line treatment. Lung resection helps to prevent fatal haemorrhage in single patients with pulmonary lesions located in close proximity to larger blood vessels  but is primarily considered for reducing the risk of relapse during subsequent periods of severe immunosuppression. Strict reverse isolation appears to reduce the incidence of aspergillosis in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients and patients with acute myeloid leukaemia undergoing aggressive anticancer therapy. Well designed  prospective randomised studies on infection control measures effective to prevent aspergillosis are lacking. Prophylactic systemic antifungal treatment with posaconazole significantly improves survival and reduces IA in acute myeloid leukaemia patients and reduces aspergillosis incidence rates in patients with intermediate-to-severe graft-versus-host reaction emerging after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Voriconazole prophylaxis may be suitable for prevention of IA as well; however  the results of large clinical trials are still awaited."

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of PCR from BAL for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in high risk patients. MEDLINE and LILACS databases (1980-2006) searches to identify articles related to PCR in diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. For inclusion  the study had to report sufficient data to calculate sensitivity  specificity and diagnostic odds ratio of the PCR-based technique. Patients with proven and probably invasive aspergillosis were considered. Forty-five articles met our initial inclusion criteria of which 15 articles were selected. Combining the results from the different reports  the overall sensitivity and specificity values of PCR-based techniques were 79% and 94%  respectively. Contamination  specific primers and method of PCR were important variables that could complicate interpretation of these tests. The present study showed support for the clinical value of PCR from BAL for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with risk factors for this disease."

We reviewed medical records of 128 patients who underwent RICBT at Toranomon Hospital between March 2002 and November 2005. Most of the patients received purine-analogbased preparative regimens. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was a continuous infusion of either tacrolimus 0.03 mg/kg or cyclosporine 3 mg/kg. IFI was diagnosed according to the established EORTC/NIH-MSG criteria. IFI was diagnosed in 14 patients. Thirteen of the 14 had probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and the other had fungemia resulting from Trichosporon spp. Median onset of IFI was day 20 (range: 1-82)  and no patients developed IFI after day 100. Three-year cumulative incidence of IA was 10.2%. Four of the 13 patients with invasive aspergillosis (IA) developed grade II-IV acute GVHD  and their IA was diagnosed before the onset of acute GVHD.

An incidence of 5.8% in a medical ICU has been reported. The majority of patients did not have a hematological malignancy  and conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and liver failure became recognized as risk factors. Diagnosis of IA remains difficult. Mechanical ventilation makes it difficult to interpret clinical signs  and radiological diagnoses are clouded by underlying lung pathologies. The significance of a positive respiratory culture result is greatly uncertain  because cultures of respiratory specimens have low sensitivity (50%) and specificity (20%-70%  depending on whether the patient is immunocompromised). The use of serologic markers has never been validated in an ICU population. Limited experience with the detection of galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens has yielded promising results. Because of a delay in the diagnosis of IA  the mortality rate exceeds 50%. Recently  our therapeutic armamentarium against IA has improved.

Duration of neutropenia and reduced-intensity conditioning were the only risk factors for IA in the multivariate model. Patients with IA had significantly reduced overall survival (8% versus 56%  P=0.01) due to higher transplant-related mortality (63% versus 31%  P=0.03).

Duration of neutropenia was the only risk factor for the development of IA following autologous HSCT. Overall survival of autologous HSCT recipients with IA was similar to that of patients without IA. Seventeen percent of autologous HSCT recipients were colonized with Candida species. Compared with non-colonized patients these patients had significantly reduced overall survival (72% versus 23%  P=0.004)  due to increased treatment-related mortality (23% versus 9%  P=0.02).

Inconsistent results have been reported in studies evaluating the efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis in patients at risk of IFI. Meta-analyses found that antifungals  such as fluconazole and itraconazole  are effective in decreasing IFI and IFI-related mortality  primarily owing to yeast infections in patients with more severe immunosuppression (i.e. patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation)  but do not decrease the overall mortality. The European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) guidelines currently recommend fluconazole (AI  ie. strongly recommended  based on at least 1 well-executed  randomized trial) and itraconazole (BI  ie. generally recommended  based on at least 1 well-executed  randomized trial) in allogeneic transplant recipients. Posaconazole  a triazole antifungal  has been recently shown to decrease IFI incidence and overall mortality in some high-risk patients compared with standard azoles. Based on preliminary data  a provisional AI ECIL recommendation has been given.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Because of the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with IFI  there is a need to accurately define patient groups at greatest risk of IFI and  when appropriate  to initiate effective antifungal prophylaxis.

We examined data from the National Center for Health Statistics and reviewed recent literature in order to update the epidemiology of IC. IC-associated mortality has remained stable  at approximately 0.4 deaths per 100 000 population  since 1997  while mortality associated with invasive aspergillosis has continued to decline. Candida albicans remains the predominant cause of IC  accounting for over half of all cases  but Candida glabrata has emerged as the second most common cause of IC in the United States  and several less common Candida species may be emerging  some of which can exhibit resistance to triazoles and/or amphotericin B. Crude and attributable rates of mortality due to IC remain unacceptably high and unchanged for the past 2 decades. Nonpharmacologic preventive strategies should be emphasized  including hand hygiene; appropriate use  placement  and care of central venous catheters; and prudent use of antimicrobial therapy. Given that delays in appropriate antifungal therapy are associated with increased mortality  improved use of early empirical  preemptive  and prophylactic therapies should also help reduce IC-associated mortality. Several studies have now identified important variables that can be used to predict risk of IC and to help guide preventive strategies such as antifungal prophylaxis and early empirical therapy. However  improved non-culture-based diagnostics are needed to expand the potential for preemptive (or early directed) therapy. Further research to improve diagnostic  preventive  and therapeutic strategies is necessary to reduce the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with IC."

Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous opportunistic fungal pathogen causing a spectrum of allergic and infectious diseases.

In view of the protective role of innate immunity in host defense against Aspergillus fumigatus  we aimed to identify the relevant innate immune proteins In a series of studies  we identified and established the therapeutic potential of pulmonary collectins SP-A and SP-D and serum collectin MBL in murine models of allergic and invasive aspergillosis. Use of SP-D for diagnosis and therapy of lung disorders and MBL for therapy of various infections including invasive aspergillosis has been patented. Genetic polymorphisms in these genes may result in partial or total loss of function and may increase the host's susceptibility to aspergillosis. Candidate gene association studies showed SNPs in SP-A2 and MBL significantly associate with patients of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bronchial asthma with rhinitis. The patients carrying either one or both of GCT and AGG alleles of SP-A2 and patients with A allele at position 1011 of MBL had markedly higher eosinophilia  total IgE antibodies and lower FEV1 (the clinical markers of ABPA). These SNPs may be useful for predicting susceptibility to allergic aspergillosis and bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis and have been patented.

Because diagnosis is still difficult  non-invasive diagnostic criteria were recently proposed by MSG/IFICG/EORTC for study purposes. We have analysed their usefulness in the clinical management of acute leukaemic patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Twenty-seven infiltrates developed during 174 chemotherapy cycles given to 50 consecutive patients. According to diagnostic criteria  IPA was diagnosed in 42% of patients and 77.8% of pulmonary infiltrates. AML diagnosis and the first induction cycle were significant risk factors. &quot;Proven&quot; IPA was rare  occurring in one patient (2%). The diagnosis of &quot;probable&quot; IPA was made in seven patients (14%) and was strongly supported by the significant association of characteristic radiological lesions (&quot;major&quot; clinical criterion) with the positivity of one microbiological criterion (P = 0.026). Conversely  &quot;possible&quot; IPA was frequent (26%) because its pertinent diagnostic criteria were fulfilled in 48.1% of pulmonary infiltrates. However  in 84.6% of cases  the diagnosis of &quot;possible IPA&quot; aspecifically derived from the association of two conditions  a new pulmonary infiltrate with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (&quot;minor clinical criterion&quot;)  together with the definition of &quot;susceptible&quot; host  which applied to 100% of our leukaemic patients.

Until then  most fungal sinus disease was perceived to occur in immunosuppressed diabetic patients with invasive fungus. It is now acknowledged that depending upon the immune status of the host  fungus-related sinus disease can take several forms. Interest in this subject matter was intensified in 1999  when it was suggested that fungi might be an important cause of most cases of chronic rhinosinusitis. This hypothesis remains controversial  and there is mounting evidence to support the multifactorial nature of chronic rhinosinusitis  which may include fungus. In fact  etiologic factors for all forms of fungus-related sinus disease are still poorly understood. The prevalence of the disease and the dominant fungal pathogen appear to vary in different geographic regions and probably are related to individual host conditions. Immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic reactions to mold appear to be associated with disease in some patients  but not in all. Although antifungal therapy is known to be lifesaving for invasive disease  its role in extramucosal disease is less well defined. Preliminary trials suggest that some systemic and topical antifungal agents are of clinical benefit in extramucosal disease. Since sinus fungi are rarely invasive in immunocompetent individuals  it is not clear whether the effects of the antifungal treatments are a result of the antifungal action itself  or due to additional properties these drugs possess. This review summarizes the available data and presents some of our clinical and experimental findings as to the role of fungus in chronic rhinosinusitis."

The major risk factor is prolonged granulocytopenia. Most literature on the epidemiology and clinical impact of Aspergillus spp. infections concern patients with hematological malignancies  cancer  stem cell transplantation and solid organ transplant patients. However  evidence from recent literature indicates that Aspergillus spp. may cause invasive disease in other categories of patients without apparent immunodeficiency  including patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Clinical diagnosis of IPA in non-immunocompromised patients is difficult. Standardized diagnostic definitions  developed by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group for research purposes in patients with cancer and in recipients of haematopoietic stem cell transplants  are not feasible for patient categories with an intermediate to low probability for acquiring IPA. In routine clinical practice  most Aspergillus isolates from non-sterile body sites do not represent disease. Invasive diagnostic procedures are often not feasible in patients with severe respiratory insufficiency and critical illness. The presence of systemic risk factors  or underlying predisposing lung disease or general debilitation  may enhance the clinical relevance of a positive culture. The finding of an Aspergillus spp. positive respiratory specimen in an ICU patient should not be discarded; pre-emptive antifungal treatment should be considered  while attempting to substantiate the diagnosis."

Hence  prevention of IA is a critical strategy that requires a clear understanding of the mould's environmental sources and how it is transmitted to immunocompromised patients. Knowledge of the exposure  mechanisms of transmission  and host susceptibility to IA are vital in selecting appropriate preventive strategies to those settings where infection is more likely to occur. Among the strategies to reduce the incidence of IA is the maintenance of high quality air  i.e. air with low spore counts in hospital areas visited by patients at risk. Housing patients in laminar airflow facilities with high-energy particulate air-filtered rooms helps prevent IA  but it is only realistic and cost-effective for the highest-risk groups and for limited time periods. Air filtration is a costly preventive strategy of questionable value when done with portable filtration units. Moreover  air control measures outside the hospital are extremely difficult to implement and this is important since the majority of cases of IA after allogeneic stem cell transplantation occurs during the post-engraftment period. For these reasons  targeted antifungal prophylaxis remains the most promising of the potential prevention strategies against IA. Many older and newer antifungal agents have been used for this purpose. Amphotericin B  being the oldest and most widely used antifungal  has been used prophylactically in various doses and schedules  but has largely been replaced by its lipid and liposomal formulations that have improved safety profile. Although prophylactic fluconazole prevents candidiasis  this drug has no activity against moulds  including Aspergillus spp. On the other hand itraconazole appears to prevent IA in those patients who can tolerate the drug  since its poor tolerability limits its use. The newer extended spectrum triazole posaconazole has been used in prophylactic trials with encouraging results in selected populations of patients at risk. Voriconazole  another extended spectrum triazole that has emerged as the treatment of choice for IA has been used as secondary prophylaxis in immunocompromised patients with history of IA. Echinocandins  such as caspofungin and micafungin appear to be extremely safe and effective for primary and secondary prophylaxis of IA. Patients undergoing transplantation for hematological malignancies from mismatched or unrelated donors are clearly at higher risk of IA compared to patients undergoing autologous transplantation  since among other risk factors they frequently receive moderate doses of corticosteroids for extended periods for Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD)  a well-known risk factor for IA. Hence  results of studies in specific populations should be analyzed with caution and prophylaxis should be applied to similar patients  because antifungals are not devoid of side effects and overuse selects for resistant fungi. In conclusion  more studies are clearly needed to better define patient populations who will clearly benefit from prophylactic antifungal therapy against IA."

Starting on day +30  patients receiving prednisone &gt; or =30 mg day(-1) were switched to twice weekly Amphotericin-B-lipid-complex (ABLC) in a dose of 4 mg kg(-1).

Seven patients were started on therapeutic daily ABLC treatment before day +30 because of documented or suspected IFI; four had definite or probable aspergillosis  and two had candidaemia. Thirty patients did not need prophylactic ABLC; only one developed candidaemia. Sixty-three patients received ABLC prophylaxis for a median of 52 days (range: 1-289). Seven of these patients developed IFI; one definite and two probable cases of aspergillosis  one case of probable Trichosporon beigelii infection  and three cases of candidaemia. The twice weekly ABLC was well tolerated. This risk-based chemoprevention appears to be effective and might diminish the role of steroids as risk factor for IFI after allogeneic SCT.

Overall  27 patients with IA progressed after the allo-HSCT (cumulative incidence [CumInc] at 2 years  22%).

However  the risk for invasive aspergillosis with time elapsed since retransplantation  clinical characteristics  and outcome of patients who develop this infection after retransplantation of the liver has not been defined. Patients comprised 17 liver retransplant recipients with invasive aspergillosis between 1990 and 2004. Retransplantation was considered early if it was performed within 30 days and late if performed after 30 days of the first or primary transplant. Retransplant recipients comprised 25% of all cases of invasive aspergillosis after liver transplantation. Fifty-three percent of the Aspergillus infections occurred within 30 days  and 76% within 90 days of retransplantation. In all  53% (9/17) of the patients were late retransplant recipients. Late compared to early retransplant recipients with invasive aspergillosis were more likely to have central nervous system involvement with invasive aspergillosis (56% vs. 0%  P = 0.03). Mortality rate was 100% for late and 63% for early retransplant recipients with Aspergillus infections. In conclusion  time-varying risk for invasive aspergillosis after retransplantation has implications relevant for guiding antifungal prophylaxis. Given a greater risk for disseminated infection and poor outcome in late retransplant recipients with aspergillosis  potent and aggressive antifungal therapy should be considered upfront in these patients."

Patients with diabetes  malignancies  solid organ or bone marrow transplants  or iron overload and those receiving immunosuppressive agents  deferoxamine therapy  or broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs are at highest risk for zygomycosis. This review details the emergence and importance of zygomycosis in current clinical practice and its manifestations and management. The etiologic species  pathogenesis and risk factors for zygomycosis are reviewed and updated. The clinical spectrum of zygomycosis is now broader  and it can be difficult to distinguish between mucormycosis and enthomophthoramycosis  both of which can manifest as disease ranging from a superficial infection to an angioinvasive infection with high mortality. Finally  the three-part treatment strategy (antifungal drugs  surgery  control of underlying diseases) is reviewed. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B are the antifungal agents of choice for treatment of zygomycosis. A novel antifungal triazole  posaconazole  has been developed and may become approved for treatment of zygomycosis. The clinical experience with adjunctive treatments like colony-stimulating factors  interferon-gamma  and hyperbaric oxygen therapy is still limited."

The aim of this study is to address the clinical significance of isolation of Aspergillus spp. from lower respiratory tract samples in critically ill patients on the basis of medical and radiological files using an adapted diagnostic algorithm to discriminate proven and probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis from Aspergillus colonisation.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Using a historical cohort (January 1997 to December 2003)  all critically ill patients with respiratory tract samples positive for Aspergillus were studied. In comparison to the EORTC/MSG criteria  a different appreciation was given to radiological features and microbiological data  including semiquantitative cultures and direct microscopic examination of broncho-alveolar lavage samples.

In 50 of these patients (60%)  no high risk predisposing conditions (neutropenia  hematologic cancer and stem cell or bone marrow transplantation) were found. Typical radiological imaging (halo and air-crescent sign) occurred in only 5% of patients. In 26 patients  histological examination either by ante-mortem lung biopsy (n = 10) or necropsy (n = 16) was performed  allowing a rough estimation of the predictive value of the diagnostic algorithm. In all patients with histology  all cases of clinical probable pulmonary aspergillosis were confirmed (n = 17).

In a minority of patients  the value of the clinical diagnostic algorithm was confirmed by histological findings  supporting its predictive value. The proposed diagnostic algorithm needs prospective validation. "

Therapy is given pre-emptively in patients at risk with additional evidence for the presence of an infective agent in a way predisposing for infection (e.g. Aspergillus colonization; high Candida colonization index). Finally  definite treatment is used in patients with confirmed fungal infection. The distinction between risk-adapted prophylaxis  early empirical therapy  and pre-emptive use of antifungals often becomes unclear and clinical decision making depends largely on local epidemiology and resistance patterns  adequate definition of patient risk categories  early diagnosis and the calculation of cost-benefit ratios. This article addresses the use of itraconazole in the treatment of invasive fungal infections in the haematology patient."

Strategies to prevent invasive fungal infections have focused primarily on the use of orally administered azole antifungal agents during the neutropenic period rather than on the more prolonged post-engraftment period. The major limitations of these studies included the heterogeneity among the subjects studied for fungal infection risk factors  the agents administered  the dosing  and duration of prophylaxis. More recent studies have attempted to examine the efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis strategies among allogeneic HSCT recipients to day 100 and beyond. It is clear that a variety of products have efficacy in preventing invasive candidiasis  including imidazole and triazole antifungals  low-dose amphotericin B  and the echinocandin  micafungin; however  only the extended spectrum azole  itraconazole  has been shown to impact the incidence of proven invasive aspergillosis. Other extended spectrum azole antifungal agents  voriconazole and posaconazole  are being studied as long-term prophylaxis in high-risk HSCT recipients. While clinical trials have suggested that a duration of prophylaxis against moulds of six months or more may be required  it remains unclear if this is required in all cases. The prophylactic efficacy over time may be linked to the degree of immunosuppression as measured by markers such as the numbers of circulating CD4 T lymphocytes. Concerns about selection for resistant moulds among long-term recipients of these drugs are emerging. The cumulative experience to date suggests that long-term antifungal chemoprophylaxis is feasible and effective when applied in defined circumstances. The concerns about treatment-related toxicities  resistance  and costs are valid."

We evaluated  retrospectively  the outcome and survival of 81 patients who were treated with voriconazole for definite (n = 48) or probable (n = 33) CNS aspergillosis. Complete and partial responses were recorded in 35% of patients and varied by the underlying disease group: hematologic malignancies (54%)  other underlying conditions (50%)  chronic immunosuppression (45%)  solid organ transplantation (36%)  and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (16%). Thirty-one percent of patients survived CNS aspergillosis for a median observation time of 390 days. There were 31 patients who underwent neurosurgical procedures  including craniotomy/abscess resection (n = 14)  abscess drainage (n = 12)  ventricular shunt (n = 4)  and Ommaya-reservoir (n = 1). Multifactorial analysis revealed that neurosurgery was associated with improved survival (P = .02). Patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had a poorer survival (P = .02)  but 7 (22%) of 32 survived for a median of 203 days. We conclude from this large cohort of patients that voriconazole treatment together with neurosurgical management  whenever feasible  is currently the best approach to treat patients with CNS aspergillosis."

Risk factors for invasive mold infection after liver transplantation were selected to divide recipients into 3 groups: (1) high risk-transplantation on hemodialysis or delay of hospital discharge beyond day 7 after transplantation because of allograft or renal insufficiency; (2) intermediate risk-retransplantation or transplantation for fulminant hepatic failure; (3) low risk-absence of conditions in groups 1 and 2. During an intervention period (February 1999-April 2001)  prophylactic administration of a lipid complex of amphotericin (Abelcet) at 5 mg/kg intravenously every 24 to 48 hours was recommended for high-risk recipients. The frequency of mold infection was compared to that of a preintervention period (February 1998-January 1999) when antifungal prophylaxis was not provided. During the intervention period  invasive mold infection developed in 2 (6%) of 35 high-risk recipients  0 of 28 intermediate-risk recipients  and 1 (0.5%) of 187 low-risk recipients. Overall  of 58 liver transplant recipients  3 (5%) developed an invasive mold infection during the preintervention period  compared with 3 (1%) of 250 during the intervention period (P = 0.08). The only death from invasive mold infection occurred during the preintervention period. Rates of pulse corticosteroid treatment of rejection and cytomegalovirus infection were lower during the intervention period. In conclusion  readily identifiable patient characteristics can be used to stratify liver transplant recipients for risk of invasive mold infection. Antifungal prophylaxis given to high-risk recipients may provide cost-effective prevention of these infections."

Label=""SUMMARY"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":The incidence of and mortality from invasive mycoses have increased in transplant patients. Candida and Aspergillus are the two most common fungal pathogens in this patient population. The use of immunosuppressive and myeloablative therapies and other factors increases the risk of invasive mycoses. A high index of suspicion and clinical clues are needed for the diagnosis of Candida and Aspergillus infections because reliable diagnostic techniques are not available and the patient presentation is nonspecific. Targeted prophylaxis for patients at high risk for morbidity and mortality and early  aggressive treatment using broad-spectrum antifungal agents are recommended. Prophylaxis using itraconazole reduces the risk of treatment failure due to resistant pathogens compared with fluconazole. Voriconazole might prove advantageous compared with fluconazole and itraconazole for prophylaxis because of its extended spectrum and predictable blood levels. Caspofungin seems as effective as and less toxic than amphotericin B for this use. Voriconazole is more effective than amphotericin B for the treatment of aspergillosis. Caspofungin is comparable to voriconazole in efficacy as salvage treatment after failure to respond to other antifungal agents.

Aspergillus was isolated from 86 (33%) cases  which involved colonisation (n = 50)  tracheobronchial lesions (n = 17) or invasive aspergillosis (n = 19). Overall  aspergillosis had an impact on survival (p &lt; 0.05); in fact the 5-year mortality rate was substantially higher in single lung transplant recipients with bronchial anastomotic infection  and in those with late-onset infections and chronic rejection.

Aspergillus infection was not related to cytomegalovirus infection or treatment with corticosteroids. The mortality rate for invasive infections was 78% and was related to survival (p &lt; 0.0001); invasive aspergillosis was also associated with chronic rejection (p &lt; 0.05)  but not with high corticosteroid doses (p 0.49) or use of tacrolimus (p 0.73).

Although outbreaks of C. parapsilosis candidemia in neonatal intensive care units contributed significantly to this shift in favour of non-albicans Candida species  a surveillance strategy comprising of molecular  epidemiologic and antifungal susceptibility studies is warranted. With the proposed expansion of organ and bone marrow transplantation facilities in Kuwait  the incidence of opportunistic fungal infections is likely to increase."

Adjunctive therapies and practical considerations that clinicians should weigh in choosing one or another of the various agents are discussed. The studies that have evaluated antifungal prophylaxis and empirical treatment strategies are reviewed. Finally  new approaches such as combination therapy  new diagnostics  and efforts to bolster host immunity are considered. In Section II  Dr. W. Garrett Nichols describes the epidemiology of community-acquired respiratory viruses (CRV) in patients with hematologic malignancies. Risk factors  clinical syndromes  and possible indirect effects of CRV infections are discussed. Treatment and prevention options are reviewed.

Cases with lesions but without concomitant signs of nasal disease probably result from cat scratch injuries. Under certain circumstances  such lacerations result in the introduction of saprophytic microorganisms in such large numbers that host defence mechanisms are overwhelmed. This results in localised  variably invasive  disease in an otherwise immunocompetent host. An unpredictable range of organisms can give rise to such infections including a variety of fungal and bacterial genera. Causal organisms will likely vary from one geography to another as a result of differences in soil type and related environmental factors. Accordingly  procurement of appropriate tissue specimens for culture and susceptibility testing is essential to guide therapy  as these cases require medical and sometimes surgical intervention in order to effect a favourable outcome. In contrast  patients with naso-ocular lesions and concurrent signs of nasal disease have a different pathogenesis. Primary infection of the sinonasal region likely results from the inhalation of infectious propagules  with the infection subsequently penetrating overlying bones to invade the subcutaneous space. These lesions are typically the result of cryptococcosis or aspergillosis and must be distinguished from invasive nasal malignancies. An approach to the investigation and treatment of these patients is presented together with photographs of representative cases."

Posttransplantation IA occurred in 13 of these 45 patients with a pretransplantation history (29%). Nine infections were considered recurrent by anatomic site and timing. Compared with all other patients who received allogeneic HCT during the same period  patients with histories of IA had lower overall survival (56% versus 77%; P =.0001) and higher transplant-related mortality (TRM; 38% versus 21%; P =.0001) 100 days after HCT  associated mainly with IA and other pulmonary complications.

The causes of this variability are multifactorial and  in large part  cannot be explained because there is insufficient understanding of the kinetics of galactomannan in vivo. We explored some of the factors that affect the release of the aspergillus antigen that bears the epitope that reacts with the monoclonal antibody used in the ELISA  its leakage from the site of infection into the blood  and its binding to substances present in the blood. Factors that affect the detection of antigen in blood are also discussed  most notably the pretreatment procedure aimed at liberating the antigen from immune complexes. Understanding the biology of galactomannan release by aspergillus will greatly enhance our understanding of the kinetics of this and other surrogate markers and allow their optimum use in the management of invasive aspergillosis."

The aim was to quantify the effects of dose-intensity and duration of corticosteroids and other risk factors. Median duration of follow-up was 330 days. There were 19 cases of IA (overall 8.8%) with 14 post-engraftment infections. In the final model  the risk of IA was greatest within 2 weeks of high-dose corticosteroids (HR 8.5  P=0.003)  with risk extending to 4 weeks with doses of 0.25-1 mg/kg/day (HR 3.1  P=0.08). Ganciclovir was associated with greatest risk (HR 13.6). Grade 3 or 4 acute GVHD (HR 5.7) and secondary neutropenia (HR=1.3) were also additive risks. In the univariate analysis  corticosteroid doses of 0.25-1.0 mg/kg/day for any duration between 2 and 10 weeks demonstrated prolonged risk for IA. Moderate doses of corticosteroids can confer an increased risk for IA for extended periods which is almost as marked as that conferred by higher doses. Knowledge of these risks may facilitate the development of targeted surveillance and prophylaxis strategies for prevention of IA."

"711","Changing strategies for the management of invasive fungal infections.","Rapp, RP","14992487",2004,NA,"Pharmacotherapy","eng","United States","The frequency of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has increased with the increase in number of high-risk patients. United States trends in mortality due to invasive mycoses showed a striking increase in the past 2 decades. Human immunodeficiency virus-associated opportunistic mycoses accounted for part of the increase  as did mycoses in other immunocompromised populations. Those at-risk populations include recipients of solid organ transplants or hematopoietic stem cell transplants  those with hematologic malignancies  and others receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Infections due to Candida sp are the most common fungal infections. The mortality rate due to invasive aspergillosis has risen steadily  with a 357% increase from 1980-1997. Depending on whether an IFI is possible  probable  or proved  three treatment strategies are available: prophylactic  empiric  and specific. Options for preventing and treating IFIs have increased  with four classes of antifungal agents available: polyenes  azoles  nucleoside analogs  and echinocandins. The effectiveness of the polyene amphotericin B deoxycholate (the standard for &gt; 40 yrs) is limited by toxic effects  notably renal and infusion-related toxicity. Three lipid formulations are approved for the treatment of IFIs in patients refractory to or intolerant of amphotericin B: amphotericin lipid complex  amphotericin B colloidal dispersion  and liposomal amphotericin B. The nucleoside analog class contains only flucytosine--an antimetabolite targeting the nucleus of the fungal cell and generally not given as monotherapy because of frequent development of resistance. The azoles debuted with ketoconazole  followed by fluconazole  itraconazole  and voriconazole. Fluconazole is largely active against Candida sp and Cryptococcus neoformans; itraconazole's activity is largely against moulds  such as Aspergillus  and dimorphic fungi  such as Histoplasma and Blastomyces; and voriconazole is active against both yeasts and moulds. The echinocandin class has one drug approved for clinical use--caspofungin  which targets the fungal cell wall. Deciding which antifungal agent to use involves weighing such clinical factors as mycoses susceptibility and drug toxicity  as well as pharmacoeconomic considerations. Besides the price of the drug  the cost of antifungal therapy includes costs of mortality associated with failed treatment  prolonged hospitalization and treatment related to complications  and additional antifungal treatment to compensate for primary treatment failure."

Seven of nine children had additional medical complications (e.g. liver failure  haemolytic uraemic syndrome and acute renal failure). In six of nine children the fungal infection was progressive despite intravenous antimycotic therapy  three patients received no antifungal therapy  as IFI was not considered. The progression of IFI despite antimycotic therapy illustrates the inherent problems of diagnosis and the need for innovative therapeutic modalities.

The development of IFI in these patients was compared with historical patients.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Two hundred and eighty liver transplant recipients were analysed over a period of 8 years. In the historical group  IFI were observed in 22 of 131 patients (17%) and invasive aspergillosis in 13 of them (10%). After January 1998  IFI were observed in nine of 149 (6%) (P &lt; 0.01) and invasive aspergillosis in six patients (4%) (P = 0.08). In patients with four or more risk factors (high risk) for IFI  the administration of L-AmpB reduced the risk from 36% to 14% (P = 0.07)  and the risk of aspergillosis from 23% to 5% (P = 0.08). Notably  prophylaxis reduced the risk of aspergillosis from 32% to 0% in dialysed patients (P = 0.03). Variables independently associated with IFI in high-risk patients were dialysis [odds ratio (OR) 3.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1-16.7] and surgical reintervention (OR 5.4; 95% CI 1.2-24.6)  while L-AmpB was a protective factor in this multivariate analysis (OR 0.1; 95% CI 0.02-0.8). The analysis in these high-risk patients was not able to demonstrate an association between the administration of L-AmpB and higher survival.

In this report  we describe two patients with polycystic kidney disease  who developed AE with cerebral involvement after renal transplantation. Both patients received intense immunosuppression with methyl prednisolone and mycophenolate mofitil (MMF) because of persistent rejection  which rendered them diabetic and vulnerable to opportunistic infections. Endophthalmitis developed within six months of transplantation and was confirmed by microscopy and culture of the vitreous fluid. Patients were treated with combinations of different anti-fungal agents including liposomal amphotericin B  5-flucytosine  itraconazole  voriconazole and terbinafine. In an electronic MEDLINE review  we found eight further cases of AE in renal transplant patients between 1959 and September 2002. Based on this review  we identified possible risk factors including CMV infection  diabetes mellitus and treatment for rejection with agents such as methyl prednisolone and MMF. In 70% of cases the histology  microscopy or culture of vitreous fluid confirmed the diagnosis. The outcome of AE in renal transplant patients was poor with 70-100% mortality. The review of reported cases and current practice guidelines suggests that vitrectomy and intravitreal amphoterecin B is the treatment of choice. In addition  new antifungal agents with good CSF and ocular penetration such as voriconalzole should be considered for the treatment of invasive cerebral/ocular aspergillosis."

These organisms are ubiquitous in nature; protection against infection is usually provided by anatomical barriers and by the immune system. Tissue invasion by Aspergillus is uncommon  occurring primarily in the setting of immunosuppression. The prognosis of invasive aspergillosis is very poor. Although it is widely recognised that critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are at risk for nosocomial infections  it is not generally appreciated that such patients may also be at risk for opportunistic infections usually seen only in immunocompromised patients. This might be explained by a biphasic immunological pattern during sepsis: an early hyperinflammatory phase followed by an anti-inflammatory response  leading to a hypo-inflammatory state  the so-called compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS or immunoparalysis). We describe four patients admitted to our ICU for various reasons  without a history of abnormal immune function  who developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. We hypothesise that the occurrence of these opportunistic infections in our patients may have been due to immunoparalysis  and that perhaps all ICU patients with sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) may be at risk for opportunistic infections such as aspergillosis as a result of this syndrome. Physicians treating critically ill patients in the ICU should be aware of the CARS/immunoparalysis syndrome and its potential to cause opportunistic infections  even in patients with normal immune function prior to ICU admission."

New promising strategies  such as detecting Aspergillus antigenemia  have been used for the diagnosis of aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients  but the impact in solid organ transplantation is not well known. A case-control study in 260 adults who underwent liver transplantation from January 1994 to June 2000 was performed. A case was defined as any liver transplant recipient with a proven or probable diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Controls were defined as a liver transplant recipient without aspergillosis infection with a survival longer than two months after transplantation. Clinical and analytical variables  including Aspergillus antigenemia  were compared. A special analysis was performed in patients in whom late aspergillosis developed (after day 100 posttransplantation). Among 260 patients  invasive aspergillosis developed in 15 (5.6%). Median time from transplantation to aspergillosis in 13 patients with sufficient data for analysis was 126 days (range  22 to 1117). Seven (54%) developed the infection after day 100 posttransplantation. Thirty-eight patients were used as controls. Antigenemia was available in nine of 13 cases and in 33 of 38 controls. By multivariate analysis  retransplantation (OR  29.9 [95% CI  2.1 to 425.1])  dialysis requirements after transplantation (OR  24.5 [95% CI  1.25 to 354])  and the presence of Aspergillus antigenemia in serum at any time point after transplantation (OR  50.0 [95% CI  3.56 to 650]) were independently associated to aspergillosis. In the subgroup of patients that developed late aspergillosis  cytomegalovirus infection (OR  6.7 [95% CI  1.0 to 42.5]) was the only independent factor associated. Hepatic and renal dysfunction predispose to Aspergillus infection in liver transplant recipients. Cytomegalovirus infection and increased immunosuppression favor invasive aspergillosis during the late posttransplantation period. Aspergillus antigenemia seems to be a good predictor of invasive aspergillosis."

We determined risks for IA and outcomes among 1682 patients who received HSCTs between January 1993 and December 1998. Risk factors included host variables (age  underlying disease)  transplant variables (stem cell source)  and late complications (acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease [GVHD]  receipt of corticosteroids  secondary neutropenia  cytomegalovirus [CMV] disease  and respiratory virus infection). We identified risk factors associated with IA early after transplantation (&lt;or= 40 days) and after engraftment (41-180 days). Older patient age was associated with an increased risk during both periods. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase was associated with low risk for early IA compared with other hematologic malignancies  aplastic anemia  and myelodysplastic syndrome. Multiple myeloma was associated with an increased risk for postengraftment IA. Use of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related (MR) peripheral blood stem cells conferred protection against early IA compared with use of MR bone marrow  but use of cord blood increased the risk of IA early after transplantation. Factors that increased risks for IA after engraftment included receipt of T cell-depleted or CD34-selected stem cell products  receipt of corticosteroids  neutropenia  lymphopenia  GVHD  CMV disease  and respiratory virus infections. Very late IA (&gt; 6 months after transplantation) was associated with chronic GVHD and CMV disease. These results emphasize the postengraftment timing of IA; risk factor analyses verify previously recognized risk factors (GVHD  receipt of corticosteroids  and neutropenia) and uncover the roles of lymphopenia and viral infections in increasing the incidence of postengraftment IA in the 1990s."

Whether recipients of nonmyeloablative HSCT have different posttransplantation infection risk was unknown. We therefore analyzed the incidence and risk of bacteremia during the first 100 days and of fungal infection during the first 365 days posttransplantation for 56 consecutive patients with hematological malignant disease who received nonmyeloablative HSCT (case patients). We compared the results with those among 112 control patients who received conventional myeloablative HSCT during the same years (January 1997-April 2000). Control patients were matched (2:1) for cytomegalovirus (CMV) risk group  HSC source  donor type  age  and underlying disease. Most donors (93%) were HLA-matched and related. Case patients had shorter periods of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count  &lt;100/mm3) than did control patients (median  0 days; range  0-11 versus 9 days; range  4-25; P &lt; .0001). This finding was associated with fewer episodes of bacteremia during the first 30 days (9% versus 27%; P = .01) and a trend to fewer episodes of bacteremia during the first 100 days posttransplantation (27% versus 41%  P = .07). Overall survival was significantly improved in case patients compared with control patients (day 100  93% versus 81%; P = .04). During the first year posttransplantation  invasive aspergillosis occurred at a similar rate (case patients  15%; control patients  9%; P value not significant). Multivariate risk factor analyses identified neutropenia and CMV disease as the major factors associated with bacteremia and aspergillosis  respectively. We conclude that shorter periods of severe neutropenia in nonmyeloablative HSCT are associated with decreased risk of early bacteremia  although risk of fungal infection late after HSCT persists. This risk is an important consideration for the future development of preventive strategies."

Reports indicate that cryptococcosis usually presents as symptomatic disease  and despite therapy the mortality remains high. In addition  some data suggest that there might be differences in the incidence and clinical manifestations of cryptococcosis  depending on the specific transplant organ. The incidence of cryptococcosis in our transplant center is significantly higher in heart transplant recipients than in other transplant groups (p=0.0001). Although the primary risk factor contributing to cryptococcosis in organ transplant recipients is probably the immunosuppressive therapy used to prevent allograft rejection  environmental factors may also play a role. This is indicated by studies that demonstrate differences in the rate of cryptococcosis according to geographic region. Moreover  data point out differences in the isolation of the fungus from soil samples with higher concentrations of Cryptococcus in areas frequented by birds or contaminated by bird droppings. Therefore  it is prudent to recommend that organ transplant recipients avoid birds or areas contaminated with bird droppings. The current review provides an overview of the changes in the incidence  clinical manifestations  and management of cryptococcosis in organ transplant recipients."

The incidence of Candida has increased: it is now the fourth most often isolated pathogen in bloodstream infections. The incidence of Aspergillus infection in transplant patients is highest in heart and lung transplants: 19-26%. Most invasive fungal infections in surgical patients are caused by Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp.  less by Cryptococcus spp. and may be classified as local or organ-related  as (chronic) disseminated  and as fungemia. There is no highly specific and sensitive routine test for the diagnosis of Candida and Aspergillus infections available; clinical signs of fungal infections are rather unspecific. The significance of colonization remains undetermined. In non-neutropenic surgical patients central venous access and broad-spectrum antibiotics are independent risk factors for the development of fungal infection. Immunsuppression  e.g.  transplantation  burn injury  can render patients susceptible to fungal infection. This has lead to the introduction of antifungal prophylaxis in transplant and burned patients which has reduced the mortality for Candida spp. infection significantly. There is no prophylaxis available against Aspergillus spp. and Cryptococcus spp. Treatment of fungal infections consists of surgical and medical treatment for most organ-related infections. Recommendations for the management of fungal infections exist mostly for neutropenic patients  only few reports address the fungal infection of the surgical intensive care patient. Amphotericin B has been recommended as first line treatment for most severe fungal infections with fluconazole as follow-up treatment. In case of the development of toxic side effects of amphotericin B  mostly fluconazole or lipid formulations of amphotericin were favored. However  a shift in Candida strains towards non-albicans spp. and more resistant species was observed during recent years. This has lead to treatment failures in severe Candida and Aspergillus infections. The prognosis for invasive Aspergillus infections remains poor despite amphotericin B treatment. Newer azoles  e.g. voriconazole  demonstrated stable activity against most of these strains and may offer an option in the treatment of refractory fungal infections."

Their incidence has risen considerably during the past decades  due to more intensive anticancer chemotherapy  organ transplantations  intensive care  and aggressive surgical interventions. Especially bone marrow transplant recipients are at risk for developing invasive aspergillosis. Whether the infection is acquired through contaminated water or through airborne spores is a matter of much debate. Candidemia and disseminated candidiasis commonly originate from the gastrointestinal tract. Abdominal surgery and mucosal damage due to anticancer chemotherapy are the majors factor through which gut colonization may lead to invasive disease. A shift in the epidemiology of disseminated candidiasis has been noted  with an increasing incidence of Candida glabrata  C. tropicalis and C. krusei strains."

Although Candida albicans and Aspergillusspp. continue to be the main pathogens  the proportion of patients infected by non-albicans species of Candida and other yeasts and by other filamentous fungi is rising in most institutions. Risk factors for the various IFI differ  and it is thus of utmost importance to realize that not all patients are the same with respect to the risk for developing the various IFI. Recent advances in diagnosis now allow the use of very sensitive imaging techniques with an extremely low negative predictive value. Among the novel microbiologic methods  the galactomannan antigen test is now commercially available for routine use in the diagnosis of aspergillosis  while DNA fungal detection is still experimental. For the first time  clinicians now have a broad range of antifungals to chose from  with special emphasis on amphotericin B preparations  novel broad-spectrum azoles  and the echinocandins.

Candidemia in a tertiary referral hospital in the Middle East confirms the current epidemiologic shift in this common blood stream pathogen towards non-malignancy cases (38%) and antifungal prophylaxis failure (20%)  high presentation sepsis scores and attributable mortality (32%). Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is also associated with high mortality. Use of non-invasive computerized tomographic (CT) radiologic scanning linked to early administration of high dose liposomal amphotericin B (LAB) is associated with a reduced mortality of 9.5% compared to historical experience of 28%.Life threatening invasive aspergillosis also occurs in patients who are less obviously immunocompromized. Investigations may reveal subtle immune deficits which could place the patient at some risk for an invasive mycosis. Antifungal treatment used in combination with progenitor cell growth factors and gamma-interferon has proved successful in such situations of progressive fungal disease unresponsive to antifungal therapy alone. Pharmacologic remodeling of existing compounds by lipidisation reduces both the toxicity denominator and the efficacy numerator of the therapeutic index when compared to the parent drug. A comparative dose study of liposomal amphotericin B in aspergillosis has demonstrated equi-efficacy  generated debate over the ability of the controlled clinical trial to be capable of assessing antifungal efficacy  and illustrated that recovery from an invasive fungal infection may require maximum tolerated doses and immunomanipulation. Several new antifungal strategies are under clinical investigation. These include reformulating existing antifungals  exploitation of the growing knowledge of virulence factors to synthesize antagonists  immune reconstitution and immunoprotection. An interim analysis of an ongoing placebo controlled study of recombinant interleukin-11 to assess its efficacy in reducing sepsis in leukemia patients through prevention of chemotherapy induced gut epithelial cell apoptosis  has demonstrated a difference in the two study arms in sepsis rates and preservation of gastrointestinal epithelial cell integrity. The unique and special challenges presented by the dynamic epidemiologics of invasive fungal infections are demanding and attracting considerable responses  in the fields of diagnosis and therapeutics. Current strategies need considerable improvement  yet ongoing collaborative efforts will have a positive impact on our understanding of the fungus-host interaction and ultimately our ability to offer better care for our patients with invasive mycoses."

As a result  the risk of fungal infections has increased substantially. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility to enable a timely diagnosis because many of the problems in the management of invasive fungal infections during neutropenia are as much the consequence of diagnostic short-comings as of lack of therapeutic options. About 7% of all febrile episodes during neutropenia can ultimately be attributed to fungi  Candida and Aspergillus species being the paramount pathogens. Although the data in favor of prophylactic use of antifungals are not convincing  prophylaxis is still recommended in an attempt to protect particularly high-risk patients. Fluconazole still appears a suitable agent in recipients of a bone marrow transplant. Given the paucity of data  reappraisal of the value of empirical antifungal therapy is warranted. Amphotericin B with or without 5-flucytosine is considered the standard therapy for acute candidiasis with fluconazole as an alternative. Amphotericin B is also first-line therapy for invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients; lipid-based formulations are recommended for patients who develop nephrotoxity.

Non-Candida IFI occurred in 37 patients (12% probability)  mostly invasive aspergillosis (n = 32).

Prophylactic strategies for these infections should thus take into account these risk factors."

Health care workers encounter at-risk patients in various settings  including AIDS clinics and intensive care  transplantation and oncology units. Patients with prolonged and deep neutropenia (haematological malignancy patients) are most at risk and are therefore most likely to receive prophylactic therapy. Practical measures can be taken to avoid exposing the patient to fungi (air filtration  regular hand washing  avoiding plants and flowers) and antifungal agents can be administered to prevent systemic fungal infection. Most fungal infections have non-specific symptoms; this makes recognition of the signs and symptoms of the disease important but also makes diagnosis difficult and empirical treatment necessary. Some antifungal agents have limitations but new formulations will improve therapy and play a key role in future antifungal strategies."

Amphotericin B has a broad spectrum and has remained the drug of choice for life-threatening invasive fungal infections. However  adverse events  particularly renal insufficiency  are limiting factors in achieving an effective dose: the prescription of amphotericin B is a compromise between toxicity and efficacy. Lipid formulations offer a better therapeutic index by circumscribing amphotericin B toxicity. Three lipid formulations are available in most countries: AmBisome  the only true liposome; Abelcet  with a ribbon-like structure; and Amphocil/Amphotec  composed of disc-like structures. All these formulations contain amphotericin B  but they differ in shape  size  reticuloendothelial clearance  C(max)  AUC and visceral diffusion. The impact of these differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics on clinical efficacy is still unclear. Efficacy has been shown in neutropenic patients with fever of unknown origin  systemic candidosis  invasive aspergillosis  cryptococcal meningitis and a variety of other difficult-to-treat mycoses  such as Fusarium or Zygomycetes infections. The effective dose may vary from one formulation to the other and is c. 3-5 mg/kg/day. All formulations are less nephrotoxic than amphotericin B. In one randomized double-blind study  AmBisome 3 or 5 mg/kg/day was less nephrotoxic and gave fewer infusion-related events than Abelcet 5 mg/kg/day. Abelcet induces fewer infusion-related side effects than Amphocil. All formulations seem at least as effective as amphotericin B. In some patients with life-threatening mycosis who failed treatment with  or were intolerant to  amphotericin B  the lipid formulations were effective. Further studies with comparable selected high-risk patients are warranted to clarify the usefulness and the indications of each of the formulations. Cost is a factor limiting prescription in many institutions  where use is often restricted to patients intolerant of  or refractory to  amphotericin B."

Acute invasive disease is potentially lethal in patients who are vulnerable to infection due to underlying lung diseases or immunosuppression.

Pulmonary aspergillosis can occur in three principal forms: saprophytic  allergic and invasive. Saprophytic aspergillosis involves colonisation of the airways  without invasion or damage of viable tissue  and may present as an aspergilloma (fungus ball) consisting of a tangled mass of mycelium  fibrin  inflammatory cells and epithelial-cell debris. Necrotic tissue also may be invaded but usually only in those severely immunocompromised. Allergic aspergillosis is referred to frequently as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)  and may occur in approximately 25% of asthmatic and 10% of cystic fibrosis patients. ABPA presents as a non-infectious  potentially fatal inflammatory disease where antigens released by the fungal mycelium provoke an immune response. Invasive aspergillosis is probably the most serious form of the disease and involves the invasion of viable tissue. It occurs predominantly in patients with pre-existing lung damage  and can spread to other organs and distant sites in the body. Aspergillomas may be detected on chest X-ray as spherical-shaped objects  whilst allergic aspergillosis may be visualised by radiological techniques and computed tomography (CT) scan.

Consideration of the epidemiology of these infections and host risk factors may be an important clue to a specific fungal diagnosis. Despite extensive investigation on methods such as serologic techniques to improve the rapid diagnosis of these infections  the diagnosis of invasive mycoses remains largely dependent on clinical presentation. For example  the signs and symptoms that result from angioinvasion of fungal organisms include pleuritic chest pain or hemoptysis. In a high-risk patient these findings can be important clues to invasive fungal infection. Cultures of opportunistic fungi in certain settings  such as Aspergillus in respiratory samples from immunosuppressed patients  may be associated with infection. Radiographic findings can also be useful to establish a diagnosis of infection. In patients with invasive aspergillosis as well as other angioinvasive moulds  chest CT scans may demonstrate lesions that are not visible on plain radiographs. Serodiagnosis of these infections remains largely investigational. Microbiological antifungal resistance has increasingly been reported  but in patients at high risk for serious fungal infection  including patients undergoing bone marrow and organ transplantation  antifungal resistance remains uncommon  particularly in Candida albicans. Higher doses of azoles should be used to treat patients with infections due to less susceptible yeasts and those with more serious infection.

This increase is directly related to the growing population of immunocompromised individuals  resulting from changes in medical practice such as the use of intensive chemotherapy and immunosuppressive drugs. HIV and other diseases which cause immunosuppression have also contributed to this problem. Superficial and subcutaneous fungal infections affect the skin  keratinous tissues and mucous membranes. Included in this class are some of the most frequently occurring skin diseases  affecting millions of people worldwide. Although rarely life threatening  they can have debilitating effects on a person's quality of life and may in some circumstances spread to other individuals or become invasive. Most superficial and subcutaneous fungal infections are easily diagnosed and readily amenable to treatment. Systemic fungal infections may be caused by either an opportunistic organism that infects an at-risk host  or may be associated with a more invasive organism that is endemic to a specific geographical area. Systemic infections can be life threatening and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Because diagnosis is difficult and the causative agent is often confirmed only at autopsy  the exact incidence of systemic infections is difficult to determine. The most frequently encountered pathogens are Candida albicans and Aspergillus spp. but other fungi such as non-albicans Candida spp. are increasingly important."

Identifying specific  remediable immune defects is of potential value. After one lung transplant patient with recurrent infections was noted to be severely hypogammaglobulinemic  a screening program for humoral immune defects was instituted. The objectives were to define the prevalence of hypogammaglobulinemia in lung transplant recipients  assess levels of antibody to specific pathogens  and correlate infectious disease outcomes and survival with immunoglobulin levels.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":All lung transplant recipients followed at a single center between October 1996 and June 1999 underwent a posttransplant humoral immune status survey as part of routine posttransplant follow-up. This survey consists of total immunoglobulin levels (IgG  IgM  IgA)  IgG subclasses (IgG1-4)  and antibody titers to Pneumococcus  diphtheria  and tetanus. Since February 1997  this survey has been incorporated into the pretransplant evaluation as well. Humoral survey results for October 1996 through July 1999 were recorded  and clinical information on major infectious disease outcomes was obtained from chart reviews  discharge summaries  the Cleveland Clinic Unified Transplant Database  and review of all microbiological studies and pathology results for each patient.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Of 67 patients with humoral immune surveys drawn posttransplant  47 (70%) had IgG levels less than 600 mg/dl (normal 717-1410 mg/dl)  of which 25 (37%) had IgG levels less than 400 mg/dl (&quot;lowest IgG group&quot;) and 22 (33%) had IgG levels between 400 and 600 mg/dl (&quot;moderately low IgG group&quot;). A total of 20 patients (30%) had IgG levels of more than 600 mg/dl (&quot;normal IgG group&quot;). Infections that were significantly more common in the lowest IgG group  and more common in the moderately low IgG group than the normal IgG group  included: number of pneumonias (P=0.0006)  bacteremias (P=0.02)  total bacterial infections (P=0.002)  tissue-invasive cytomegalovirus (P=0.01)  invasive aspergillosis (P=0.001)  total fungal infections (P=0.001)  and total infections (P=0.006). Median hospital days per posttransplant year was significantly different in the three groups (11.0 vs. 7.4 vs. 2.8 days  P=0.0003.) Invasive aspergillosis occurred in 44% of the lowest IgG group  9% of the moderately low IgG group  and 0% of the normal IgG group (P&lt;0.001). Survival was poorest in the lowest IgG group and intermediate in the moderately low IgG group. IgG subclass deficiencies occurred in a variety of patterns. Hypogammaglobulinemic patients lacked protective responses to Pneumococcus in 14/47 (30%)  diphtheria in 15%  and tetanus in 19%. In a group of 48 patients screened pretransplant  90% had normal immunoglobulin levels.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Hypogammaglobulinemia in lung transplant recipients is more common than has been previously recognized. An IgG level of less than 400 mg/dl identifies a group at extremely high risk of bacterial and fungal infections  tissue-invasive cytomegalovirus  and poorer survival. Immunoglobulin monitoring may offer an opportunity for intensive surveillance  tapering of immunosuppression  and preemptive therapy for infection. "
"782","Prophylaxis against fungal infections and cytomegalovirus disease after bone marrow transplantation.","Wilkin, A","11212856",2001,NA,"Oncology (Williston Park)","eng","United States","Among the serious complications associated with bone marrow transplantation are invasive fungal infections caused by organisms such as Candida and Aspergillus species and end-organ disease caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV). Successful prevention of these complications can have a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. The primary option for prophylaxis against fungal infections is fluconazole (Diflucan). Low doses of intravenous amphotericin B may be useful where there is a higher rate of aspergillosis. Itraconazole (Sporanox) and nasal amphotericin B are other options that have been less well studied. The development of fluconazole-resistant candidiasis may become problematic. Ganciclovir (Cytovene) is useful for the prevention of end-organ disease caused by CMV but carries a significant risk for neutropenia. New techniques for the early detection of CMV infection should allow prophylaxis to be targeted to patients at highest risk of developing CMV disease. It is critical to clearly define the risk factors for fungal and CMV disease in the individual patient in order to minimize adverse effects and provide the optimal prophylactic benefit."

Candidiasis and aspergillosis account for most invasive fungal infections. General prophylactic measures include strict hygiene and environmental measures. Haemopoietic growth factors shorten the duration of neutropenia and thus may reduce the incidence of fungal infections. Fluconazole is appropriate for antifungal prophylaxis and should be offered to patients with prolonged neutropenia  such as high-risk patients with leukaemia undergoing remission induction or consolidation therapy and high-risk stem cell transplant recipients. Empirical antifungal therapy is mandatory in patients with persistent febrile neutropenia who fail to respond to broad-spectrum antibacterials. Intravenous amphotericin B at a daily dose of 0.6 to 1 mg/kg is preferred whenever aspergillosis cannot be ruled out. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B have demonstrated similar efficacy and are much better tolerated. Fluconazole is the best choice for acute candidiasis in stable patients; amphotericin B should be used in patients with unstable disease. Use of fluconazole is restricted by the existence of resistant strains (Candida krusei and  to a lesser extent  C. glabrata). Amphotericin B still remains the gold standard for invasive aspergillosis. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B are effective in aspergillosis and because they are less nephrotoxic are indicated in patients with poor renal function. Itraconazole is an alternative in patients who have good intestinal function and are able to eat. Mucormycosis  trichosporonosis  fusariosis and cryptococcosis are less common but require specific management. New antifungal agents  especially new azoles  are under development. Their broad in vitro spectrum and preliminary clinical results are promising."

We describe 6 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who developed CNS aspergillosis  and we review a total of 33 cases of CNS aspergillosis among HIV-infected individuals that were diagnosed by histology and/or culture. All patients were diagnosed with advanced HIV infection. Major risk factors for the disease included neutropenia and corticosteroid use. The most common presenting symptoms were nonspecific neurologic manifestations including headache  cranial or somatic nerve weakness or paresthesia  altered mental status  and seizures. The most common sites of additional Aspergillus involvement were the lungs  sinuses  ears  and orbits  while in one-fourth of the cases CNS was the only site of Aspergillus infection. The final diagnosis of CNS aspergillosis was made on autopsy in more than half the cases  and medical treatment of CNS aspergillosis was unsuccessful in all cases. CNS aspergillosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of HIV-infected patients who present with nonspecific neurologic symptoms and signs. If we take into account the much higher prevalence of invasive aspergillosis of the lungs  the findings in the present report suggest that CNS aspergillosis in HIV-infected individuals occurs more often as a result of direct extension from the sinuses  orbits  and ears than through hematogenous spread from the lungs.

The major risk factors for aspergillosis were bone marrow transplantation (32%) and hematologic malignancy (29%)  but patients had a variety of underlying conditions including solid organ transplants (9%)  AIDS (8%)  and pulmonary diseases (9%). Overall  high antifungal failure rates occurred (36%)  and complete antifungal responses were noted in only 27%. Treatment practices revealed that amphotericin B alone (187 patients) was used in most severely immunosuppressed patients while itraconazole alone (58 patients) or sequential amphotericin B followed by itraconazole (93 patients) was used in patients who were less immunosuppressed than patients receiving amphotericin B alone. Response rate for patients receiving amphotericin B alone was poor  with complete responses noted in only 25% and death due to or with aspergillosis in 65%. In contrast  patients receiving itraconazole alone or following amphotericin B had death due to or with Aspergillus in 26% and 36%  respectively. These results confirm that mortality from invasive aspergillosis in severely immunosuppressed patients remains high even with standard amphotericin B. Improved responses were seen in the less immunosuppressed patients receiving sequential amphotericin B followed by itraconazole and those receiving itraconazole alone.

Candidemia is now the fourth leading cause of bloodstream infections in many intensive care units (ICUs). Although a number of risk factors have been identified  antifungal therapy should not be started in non-neutropenic patients until a diagnosis of invasive candidiasis or candidemia is made or presumed in order to avoid the development of resistance. Even a single positive blood culture should be treated  and requires removal of intravascular lines. Fluconazole is the first line agent for treatment candidemia other than that caused by Candida glabrata or C. krusei. High-resolution CT scan pictures showing a halo sign or crescent air sign are helpful for establishing the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Sandwich ELISA can be used to detect circulating galactomannan in serial serum samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood samples may also be used. There are only a few randomized studies of newly developed antifungal drugs compared to conventional amphotericin B (AmB). So far  both AmB colloidal dispersion and AmB lipid complex have failed to show more favorable efficacy or lesser toxicity rates  except for nephrotoxicity. Liposomal AmB  used during febrile neutropenia  did have a significantly lower toxicity rate. In neutropenic patients with invasive fungal infections liposomal AmB proved to be better than conventional AmB in terms of clinical efficacy  mortality and nephrotoxicity rates. The use of tests to achieve an earlier diagnosis combined with more potent treatment formulations such as liposomal AmB may be significant steps towards successful management of invasive fungal infections."

Circulating antigens were found in five of seven proven cases of IA due to A. fumigatus. In two of the five positive cases  antigenemia was detected with inhibition-EIA earlier than with X ray or other biological methods. No antigens were detected in the sera from two patients with proven IA due to Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus terreus nor in the sera from four patients with probable IA. Circulating antigens were not detected in the control group  composed of 30 healthy adult blood donors. Four of the 32 at-risk patients examined  though they displayed no definite evidence of IA  gave a positive result in this test. The sensitivity  specificity  and positive predictive value of inhibition-EIA were 71.4  94.4  and 71.2%  respectively. The data were compared with those obtained by a latex agglutination assay of galactomannan (GM) that was positive in only one patient with probable IA. The higher sensitivity obtained by inhibition-EIA may well be due to its ability to detect circulating antigens other than GM in the sera of IC patients with IA. Detecting these antigens may improve the diagnosis of IA  as they may serve as markers of this infection."

Candida and Aspergillus are among the major pathogens in these patients. Many patients remaining neutropenic over a prolonged period of time will receive empirical antifungal therapy. The clinical and laboratory diagnoses of these infections are neither sensitive nor specific and are generally limited in the early detection of invasive fungal infection. However  several new approaches to diagnosis are being developed  which should be translated into routine practice  based on a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of systemic fungal infection and virulence determinants of fungal pathogens. These include antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction. Patients with presumed fungal infection require more intense and accurate monitoring for signs of disseminated infection.

The purpose of this study was to define the relationship between neutrophil (polymorphonuclear  PMN) recovery after chemotherapy-induced bone marrow aplasia and the occurrence of severe pulmonary complications (haemoptysis  pneumothorax and death) in patients with haematological malignancies who developed invasive fungal pneumonias.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Twenty consecutive patients were retrospectively studied; eight of them had developed pulmonary events between 5 and 11 days after neutrophil recovery that followed deep neutropenia (PMN &lt; 100 microL-1).                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Five patients had haemoptysis (one of these also had pneumothorax) and three had pneumothorax. According to the multiplicative logistic model  the odds of occurrence of a pulmonary event increased significantly with increasing PMN count on the fifth day (P &lt; 0.001). Five of the eight patients who had pulmonary complications died. Also  the risk of death was larger in the presence of rapid neutrophil recovery  although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.111). Analysis of clinical and laboratory data showed that the risk of pulmonary complications significantly increased when the neutrophil concentration was &gt; 4500 microL-1 on day 5 after deep granulocyte neutropenia (PMN &lt; 100 microL-1). There was no correlation between pulmonary complications  dosage of amphotericin B and deaths.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":The occurrence of life-threatening complications in patients with invasive fungal pneumonia is closely related to rapid PMN recovery. "
"802","Antifungal prophylaxis in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies: is there a real benefit?","Böhme, A","10224346",1999,"10.1159/000007187","Chemotherapy","eng","Switzerland","Invasive fungal infections have been reported with an increasing incidence over the last 20 years. Fungal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. Therefore  in neutropenic patients different regimens of antifungal prophylaxis have been performed for more than 20 years  but the effect of antifungal prophylaxis is controversial. A long duration of neutropenia  impaired cell-mediated immunity as well as continuous corticosteroid therapy and sustained immunosuppression for graft-versus-host disease in patients treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are known risk factors for invasive mycosis. Since early diagnosis of invasive fungal infection is difficult  strategies to prevent fungal infections seem to be attractive. The introduction of triazoles have provided us with a better armamentarium to prevent fungal infections. In this review  the current strategies of antifungal prophylaxis are discussed. Antifungal prophylaxis has been effective in reducing candida infection  however  there has been no proven successful prevention of invasive aspergillosis. In addition  there is no clearly proven benefit of antifungal prophylaxis regarding the reduction in the overall mortality. Thus the best way to reduce invasive fungal-related mortality will be early diagnosis and preemptive therapeutic approaches."

Invasive aspergillosis was diagnosed as the cause of death in 48 (4%) cases  four (8%) of which did not involve severe primary immunosuppression. In seven (15%) cases no pulmonary involvement was found; in six of these cases the portal of infection could not be established  whereas in one case invasive aspergillosis originated from Aspergillus peritonitis. Aspergillus grew in 42% of the samples obtained from the respiratory tracts of 32 patients with pulmonary aspergillosis and submitted within 10 days antemortem; at least one positive culture was obtained from 20 (63%) of these patients. It is concluded that the diagnosis of aspergillosis by means of culture has an appreciable sensitivity. Fatal invasive aspergillosis was rare among patients without severe immunosuppression  whereas invasive aspergillosis without pulmonary involvement was unexpectedly frequent."

Immunosuppression from debilitating disease may also predispose horses to aspergillosis. Because invasive pulmonary aspergillosis can be difficult to diagnose  clinicians should be aware of clinical and epidemiologic settings in which this disease would develop. "

Aspergillus flavus was present in 12 (41 %) of the 29 patients  Aspergillus terreus in nine (31%) and Aspergillus fumigatus in eight (28%). The susceptibility of these isolates to amphotericin B varied between and within the three species. A. terreus was the only organism against which the MIC was consistently high  A. fumigatus and A. flavus showing variation between isolates in the degree of resistance to amphotericin B. The degree of in-vitro resistance was the only parameter correlating with clinical outcome in a univariate analysis and the only prognostic value in a multivariate analysis considering known risk factors. Irrespective of the species  all six patients with isolates against which the MIC was &lt;2 mg/L survived  whereas most (22/23) of those with isolates resistant to &gt; or = 2 mg/L died. Infections among the six survivors were caused by amphotericin B-susceptible A. fumigatus and A. flavus  but not A. terreus. We conclude that the outcome of aspergillus infection depends on the in-vitro susceptibility of the isolates to amphotericin B. Survival was poor in patients with isolates resistant to amphotericin B and good in those with amphotericin B-susceptible specimens. A. terreus was always associated with high resistance to amphotericin B and with poor survival."

During September 1994 to December 1995  77 patients undergoing 96 neutropenic episodes (mean duration  19.3 days +/- 9.1) received itraconazole as antifungal prophylaxis. All patients were treated in laminar air flow rooms. Itraconazole was administered at a loading dose of 600mg/d  (day 1 to day 3) and 400mg/d on the following days  in 87 instances. In the remaining episodes  the daily dose was 200 or 400mg. Oral doses were adjusted to reach a plasma itraconazole level (PIL) above 1000ng/l. In cases of inadequate PIL or poor oral intake  IV AmphoB was started at a 20 mg daily dose. Five cases of IPA (proven n = 2  probable n = 3) were observed.

One out of 67 (2%) treatment episodes with adequate PIL were associated with IPA as compared to 4 of 29 (14%) episodes with inadequate PIL  (p &lt; 0.02). AmphoB was added in 28 cases because of low PIL (n = 25)  and/or antibiotic-resistant fever persistent pulmonary infiltrate (n = 8).

It is clear that the prevention of severe fungal infection by the use of effective infection control measure should be the priority of the teams involved in managing at-risk patients. The evidence from clinical and molecular epidemiological studies is reviewed and current thinking on sources and routes of transmission of the organism are discussed.

The median time to the diagnosis of IFI was 136 days after BMT (range 6-466 days). Only 14% of the IFIs were found during the neutropenic period post-BMT. Of the pretransplant characteristics  hematological disease (MDS vs other) (P = 0.001) and unrelated donor (P = 0.01) were risk factors for IFI. Acute GVHD grade III-IV (P = 0.03) and extensive chronic GVHD (P = 0.0002) were also found to be significant risk factors. Only three patients with IFI (14%) became long-term survivors. Invasive fungal infections tended to develop late after BMT  were usually caused by Aspergillus sp.  and were strongly associated with GVHD and its treatment. Better prophylaxis and treatment of IFI are needed. More effective prophylaxis for GVHD might decrease the risk of IFI after allogeneic BMT."

In cancer patients  the main risk factor for the development of systemic fungal disease is severe  prolonged neutropenia. Other factors  such as mucosal damage  presence of a central venous line  immunosuppressive therapy and treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics are contributory. Candida spp. are the fungi most commonly isolated in neutropenic patients. There has been a dramatic increase in non-C. albicans species  such as C. glabrata and C. krusei  largely as a result of extensive prophylactic and therapeutic use of fluconazole  to which these species are largely resistant. In neutropenic patients with candidaemia  amphotericin B is the drug of choice although the conventional formulation may be poorly tolerated. Lipid-based forms of amphotericin B  such as Abelcet  are better tolerated and can be given at a much higher dose and should therefore be considered in patients who fail on or are intolerant to the conventional agent. Aspergillosis is the second most frequent fungal infection in neutropenic patients. Primary invasive aspergillosis usually presents on chest X-ray with lung lesions and the brain is a frequent site of secondary infection. Fluconazole is inactive against Aspergillus spp. and amphotericin B is the standard treatment. Again  lipid-based forms are better tolerated than the conventional formulation in this setting  and have been shown to achieve response rates of 60% or more in a number of trials. Other potentially life-threatening fungal infections in which lipid-based amphotericin B may play an important therapeutic role in the future include cryptococcosis (increasingly problematic in AIDS patients)  trichosporonosis  fusariosis and mucormycosis. Further randomized studies should be performed in a range of fungal infections to compare Abelcet with conventional amphotericin B and other lipid-based antifungal agents."

These are reviewed with 30 previously reported cases with special attention to radiographic appearance of disease and how radiographic appearance influences clinical outcome.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Symptoms of pulmonary aspergillosis in AIDS were nonspecific  most often including fever  cough  and dyspnea  and less commonly  chest pain or hemoptysis. Major risk factors for the development of pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with AIDS were steroid administration and neutropenia. Neutropenia was often a complication of therapies for AIDS  in particular  ganciclovir and zidovudine. Radiographic appearance of disease could be divided into three general categories. One third of the patients (13/36) presented with cavitary upper lobe disease resembling noninvasive or chronic necrotizing aspergillosis. Fatal hemoptysis occurred in 42 percent of patients with this form of disease. Twenty-two percent (8/36) of the cases presented as a nondescript focal alveolar opacity similar to invasive aspergillosis. In several patients  the focal infiltrate remained stable for several months  a feature that is unusual for aspergillosis in non-AIDS patients. The air crescent sign was present in none of the 36 reported cases. Patients with only focal disease had the best prognosis of patients with pulmonary aspergillosis. Bilateral alveolar or interstitial disease similar to invasive aspergillosis was present in 23 percent (9/36) of the patients. Bilateral disease appears to be a marker for disseminated infection and was associated with a high mortality due to aspergillosis. Two new forms of bronchial aspergillosis (5/36 cases) have been described previously. These patients presented with either obstructing fungal casts or bronchial pseudomembranes demonstrated bronchoscopically. In some patients with the bronchial forms of aspergillosis  transient alveolar opacities were seen on chest radiographs. These opacities may represent regions of atelectasis due to airway obstruction. One patient who had bilateral pneumothoraces without parenchymal opacities did not correspond to any of the three previously mentioned categories. Mortality due to aspergillosis was greater than 50 percent among AIDS patients. Death was subsequent to fatal hemoptysis or widespread pulmonary or systemic infection.                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Unlike other risk groups that tend to contract only one form of pulmonary aspergillosis  AIDS patients can develop the whole spectrum of aspergillosis-related pulmonary disorders  including chronic cavitary  invasive  and bronchial forms of aspergillosis. Clinical symptoms are nonspecific and major risk factors include neutropenia  which is often a side effect of various therapies for AIDS  and steroid administration. Patients with the chronic cavitary form of disease have an unusually high mortality due to fatal hemoptysis. Patients with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and aspergillosis have a high mortality due to disseminated infection. "

Four of the 11 cases occurred early  and seven cases were observed after neutrophil recovery and discontinuation of amphotericin B inhalation treatment. Late infection was significantly associated with the development of acute graft-versus-host disease. Four of the 11 infections (early 2/4; late: 2/7) were observed in patients with a history of previous fungal infection. Other patient and treatment characteristics were not helpful in defining potential risk factors. In particular  the incidence of invasive fungal infections did not differ between patients with more or less strict reverse isolation measures.

Macrophages play a significant role in the host defenses against Aspergillus organisms by ingesting conidia and preventing their germination to hyphae. The antifungal activity of peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) from 19 HIV-infected children was compared with that of 16 normal controls. The phagocytic activity of patients' MDM  measured as percentage of phagocytosis  was significantly decreased compared with normal donors (P = .014). In addition  the inhibitory activity of MDM on germination of intracellular A. fumigatus conidia was significantly impaired in patients compared with normal controls (P = .016). There was no significant difference in the defects between patients with lower or higher CD4 lymphocyte counts. Impairment of antifungal activity of macrophages may contribute to the susceptibility of HIV-infected patients to aspergillosis."

Four patients had invasive pulmonary aspergillosis  six probable pulmonary invasive aspergillosis and one allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was confirmed to be an useful tool for the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis in AIDS patients. The response of aspergillosis to therapy  either amphotericin B or itraconazole  has usually been poor. It is possible to speculate that the longer survival of AIDS patients and the latter development of other functional immunological abnormalities related to HIV infection may allow the appearance of opportunistic infection  such as pulmonary aspergillosis  different from those more often observed."

Label=""STUDY SELECTION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Clinical trials that evaluated itraconazole therapy in either allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis  aspergilloma  or invasive aspergillosis were critically reviewed. Trials were evaluated based upon entry criteria for the diagnosis of each type of aspergillosis  risk factors for the development of aspergillosis (neutropenia  transplant recipient  hematologic malignancy)  prior antifungal chemotherapy  and dose and duration of itraconazole therapy.

In the treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis  itraconazole has been reported to prompt a reduction in corticosteroid dosage in selected patients. There have been no controlled trials of itraconazole as treatment for aspergilloma  but data from several open-label trials suggest that this agent may be of clinical benefit in aspergilloma  primarily as an alternative to surgery. The use of itraconazole for invasive aspergillosis has been evaluated in several trials  most often in patients who were intolerant to amphotericin B treatment. Response to oral itraconazole has generally been promising.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Although itraconazole offers promise for oral therapy against infections caused by Aspergillus spp.  it should not presently be regarded as primary therapy for any of these diseases. Amphotericin B  in doses ranging from 1 to 1.5 mg/kg to a total dose of 1.5-4.0 g  should remain the treatment of choice in both aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis. Itraconazole use should be restricted to patients who experience severe toxicity with amphotericin B therapy. Corticosteroids continue to be first-line therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis  with the use of itraconazole reserved for those patients who would benefit from a reduction in corticosteroid dose.

The role of AIDS itself is controversial  because many of the reported patients exhibited the classic risk factors such as neutropenia and steroid therapy. The aims of this study were to report 33 patients with IA during AIDS and their outcome  focusing on the risk factors and the value of diagnostic procedures.                 Label=""PATIENTS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":Thirty-three patients from 17 different medical centers in France were retrospectively included in the study. For pulmonary IA  we defined two types of patients: those with &quot;confirmed IA &quot; describing all the patients with histologically proven disease  and those with &quot;probable IA &quot; who had the development of a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiograph and a positive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid culture for Aspergillus species without identification of other pathogens. For extrapulmonary IA  the diagnostic criteria included both positive histology and culture.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Of the 33 cases included in this series  91% were recorded during the last 3 years (1989 to 1991)  suggesting that aspergillosis is an emerging complication in AIDS. Approximately 50% of the patients did not exhibit any classic risk factor  i.e.  neutropenia and steroid treatment; almost all patients had a CD4 cell count less than 50/mm3. The mycologic culture from BAL was the method of choice for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary disease because it was known to correlate well with histologic findings obtained either antemortem or postmortem. Of 28 patients with a positive BAL culture for Aspergillus  15 underwent a biopsy or autopsy and 14 were positive at histology. Serum antigen detection was positive in only 4 of 16 tested patients. Clinical and radiologic signs did not differ from those observed in neutropenic patients without human immunodeficiency virus  except for the higher incidence of neurologic complications in AIDS. Interestingly  we observed three cases of invasive necrotizing tracheobronchial aspergillosis with acute dyspnea and wheezing. The use of amphotericin B (0.5 mg/kg/d) and/or itraconazole (200 to 600 mg/d) was most often unsuccessful. Only four patients experienced clinical and radiologic improvement. The mean interval between the diagnosis of IA and death was 8 weeks (range: 3 days to 13 months).                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":This study suggests that aspergillosis is an important life-threatening condition in the advanced stage of AIDS. It requires an early diagnosis with BAL fluid culture and careful therapeutic evaluation. "

This retrospective analysis involved 21 patients treated in two hematologic centers over a six-year period. All were treated in protective isolated rooms with high-dose amphotericin B as soon as fungal infection was suspected. Ten (45%) of the twenty-one patients died. There was no statistical difference between the patients who survived and those who died in relation to the mean time of onset of IA or the total and mean daily dose of amphotericin B. On the other hand a favourable outcome correlated strongly with complete leukemic remission (p &lt; 0.0001): all but one of the patients with objective residual leukemia died of IA  whereas all those who achieved complete hematological remission survived. In conclusion  it seems that the main vital prognostic factor in these leukemic patients with IA was the achievement of complete remission. We were unable to control IA in 10 of 11 patients with refractory leukemia  regardless of neutropenic status  despite early administration of high-dose amphotericin B. All the patients who achieved complete remission were successfully treated with amphotericin B."

Oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify a 401-bp fragment spanning the 26S/intergenic spacer region of the rDNA complex of A. fumigatus by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primers were highly sensitive and specific: as little as 1 pg of A. fumigatus genomic DNA could be detected  and the primers only amplified DNA from A. fumigatus and not any other fungal  bacterial  viral  or human DNA tested. Using the PCR  we were able to detect A. fumigatus DNA in lung homogenates from immunosuppressed mice experimentally infected with A. fumigatus but not from immunosuppressed uninfected controls. There was 93% correlation between the culture results and the PCR results. In a retrospective clinical study  the sensitivity of the PCR for the detection of A. fumigatus in clinical samples was confirmed by positive amplification in three of three culture-positive respiratory samples from confirmed cases of IA. Because isolation of Aspergillus spp. may reflect contamination and colonization without infection  the feasibility of using the PCR was evaluated by analyzing culture-negative samples from both immunosuppressed patients at high risk for IA and immunocompetent patients with other lung infections. Only 2 of 10 patients were culture negative and PCR positive in the high-risk group  and 2 of 7 patients were culture negative and PCR positive in the immunocompetent group. The results indicate that PCR detection might be a valuable adjunct to current laboratory methods to diagnose IA."

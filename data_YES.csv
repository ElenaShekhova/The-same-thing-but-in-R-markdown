1,3,3,Elena,NO,Severe Influenza With Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Immunocompetent Hosts: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Duan, Y",33537328,2021,10.3389/fmed.2020.602732,Front Med (Lausanne),eng,Switzerland,Background: Influenza was an independent risk factor for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). In light of increasing incidence and mortality of influenza associated aspergillosis  our study summarized risk factors  clinical characteristics  and prognostic factors of developing aspergillosis in immunocompetent hosts with influenza to further screen high-risk population and improve outcome. Methods: We reviewed the patient characteristics  laboratory examinations  radiological imaging  and microbiology data of 72 influenza patients with IPA and 84 influenza patients without IPA admitted to West China Hospital. Result: Our study shown that aspergillosis co-infection increased overall mortality of severe influenza from 22.6 to 52.8%  along with higher white blood count (WBC) (10.9 ± 5.0 vs. 8.4 ± 3.3  P = 0.016)  Neutrophiles (9.5 ± 5.0 vs. 7.0 ± 3.8  P = 0.023)  procalcitonin (PCT) (8.6 ± 15.9 vs. 1.2 ± 2.1  P = 0.009)  and a lower CD4+ T cell count (189.2 ± 135.3 vs. 367.1 ± 280.0  P = 0.022) in death group. No impact of age  gender  underlying diseases  immunosuppressive agents and steroids use  CD4+ T cell count on incidence of influenza associated aspergillosis was observed. But influenza associated aspergillosis cases mostly accompanied with more H1N1 subtype (91.7 vs. 79.8%  P = 0.037) and higher level of C-reactive protein (CRP) (117.6 ± 88.1 vs. 78.5 ± 75.2  P = 0.017) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) (133.5 ± 149.2 vs. 69.9 ± 100.0  P = 0.021) than those without aspergillosis. Conclusion: Aspergillosis co-infection in severe influenza patients can lead to a significant increased mortality  which was associated with severe respiratory failure due to mixed infection and immunosuppression. Pulmonary excessive inflammatory response was related with IPA co-infection.

Label=""METHODS"":We conducted a monocenter retrospective study comparing the incidence of VAP and invasive aspergillosis between patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS) and those with non-SARS-CoV-2 viral ARDS (NC-ARDS).                 Label=""RESULTS"":We assessed 90 C-ARDS and 82 NC-ARDS patients  who were mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h. At ICU admission  there were significantly fewer bacterial coinfections documented in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 14 (16%) vs 38 (48%)  p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01. Conversely  significantly more patients developed at least one VAP episode in C-ARDS as compared with NC-ARDS: 58 (64%) vs. 36 (44%)  p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.007. The probability of VAP was significantly higher in C-ARDS after adjusting on death and ventilator weaning [sub-hazard ratio<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.72 (1.14-2.52)  p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01]. The incidence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MDR)-related VAP was significantly higher in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 21 (23%) vs. 9 (11%)  p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.03. Carbapenem was more used in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS: 48 (53%)  vs 21 (26%)  p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.01. According to AspICU algorithm  there were fewer cases of putative aspergillosis in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS [2 (2%) vs. 12 (15%)  p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.003]  but there was no difference in Aspergillus colonization.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"":In our experience  we evidenced a higher incidence of VAP and MDR-VAP in C-ARDS than in NC-ARDS and a lower risk for invasive aspergillosis in the former group. "

We used a strengthened IPA testing strategy including seven mycological criteria. Patients were classified as probable IPA according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium (MSGERC) classification if immunocompromised  and according to the recent COVID-19-associated IPA classification otherwise.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Probable IPA was diagnosed in 21 out of the 366 COVID-19 patients (5.7%) admitted to the ICU and in the 108 patients (19.4%) who underwent respiratory sampling for deterioration. No significant differences were observed between patients with and without IPA regarding age  gender  medical history and severity on admission and during hospitalization. Treatment with azithromycin for =3 days was associated with the diagnosis of probable IPA (odds ratio 3.1  95% confidence interval 1.1-8.5  p = 0.02). A trend was observed with high-dose dexamethasone and the occurrence of IPA. Overall mortality was higher in the IPA patients (15/21  71.4% versus 32/87  36.8%  p &lt; 0.01).

Azithromycin  known to have immunomodulatory properties  may contribute to increase COVID-19 patient's susceptibility to IPA. "
4,15,15,Elena,YES,Risk Factors for Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Critically Ill Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019-Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.,"Chauvet, P",33205046,2020,10.1097/CCE.0000000000000244,Crit Care Explor,eng,United States,Severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Recently  several publications reported on coronavirus disease 2019-associated pulmonary aspergillosis. However  risk factors remain unclear. We retrospectively collected all the cases of coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients (n = 46) admitted to our 34-bed ICU between March 24  2020  and May 25  2020  and identified six patients that met the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis according to previously established definitions. This population exhibited higher severity scores at admission and less hospital discharge compared with noninvasive pulmonary aspergillosis patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  malnutrition  and systemic corticosteroid use were identified as risk factors for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in coronavirus disease 2019-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. Coronavirus disease 2019-associated pulmonary aspergillosis may be a serious concern regarding corticosteroids use to control the inflammatory response of coronavirus disease 2019-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
5,20,20,Elena,NO,Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"Apostolopoulou, A",33050499,2020,10.3390/diagnostics10100807,Diagnostics (Basel),eng,Switzerland,In this systematic review  we investigate the epidemiology  pathogenesis  risk factors  clinical manifestations  diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We identified 85 cases from 22 studies. The frequency of CAPA is currently unknown but ranges between &lt;5% to &gt;30% in different case series; the possibility of colonization rather than invasive disease is the most important confounder. The vast majority of patients with CAPA did not have any of the classic host risk factors  such as immunosuppression from organ transplant or neutropenia  although a significant proportion (46%) had received corticosteroids. Age  pulmonary comorbidities and male sex were associated with higher mortality. Patients treated with voriconazole had numerically lower case-fatality rate. Clinical vigilance for CAPA is advisable in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who are not improving  even those who do not meet classic host criteria for invasive mycoses  especially if they are receiving corticosteroids. A thorough  multi-faceted diagnostic work-up and early initiation of a mold-active triazole may be lifesaving. Further research studies using standardized  uniform definitions of invasive disease and colonization are urgently needed.
6,25,25,Elena,NO,Short course of voriconazole therapy as a risk factor for relapse of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Shin, DH",32999399,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-73098-w,Sci Rep,eng,England,To investigate associations of the duration of voriconazole treatment and radiological response with relapse of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in immunocompromised patients  we explored the risk factors for IPA relapse after successful initial treatment. All patients with proven or probable IPA who had finished voriconazole treatment between 2005 and 2019 in a tertiary-care hospital were reviewed. IPA relapse was defined as re-diagnosis of proven or probable IPA at the same site within 1 year after treatment termination. Short course of voriconazole treatment was defined as a treatment less than 9 weeks  which is a median of the recommended minimum duration of therapy from the Infectious Disease Society of America. The radiological response was defined as a reduction in IPA burden by more than 50% on chest computed tomography. Of 87 patients who had completed voriconazole treatment  14 (16.1%) experienced IPA relapse. Multivariable Cox regression identified that short voriconazole treatment duration (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]  3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]  1.1-12.3; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.033) and radiological non-response (aHR  4.6; 95% CI  1.2-17.5; P<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.026) were independently associated with relapse of IPA after adjusting for several clinical risk factors. Longer duration of therapy should be considered for those at higher risk of relapse.

The aim of our study is to develop a risk predictive model for IPA through machine learning techniques (decision trees) in patients with influenza. We conducted a retrospective observational study analyzing data regarding patients diagnosed with influenza hospitalized at the University Hospital &quot;Umberto I&quot; of Rome during the 2018-2019 season. We collected five IPA cases out of 77 influenza patients. Although the small sample size is a limit  the most vulnerable patients among the influenza-infected population seem to be those with evidence of lymphocytopenia and those that received corticosteroid therapy.

10,48,48,Elena,NO,Low Rate of Invasive Fungal Infections During Induction and Consolidation Chemotherapy for Adults with De Novo Acute Myeloid Leukemia Without Anti-mold Prophylaxis: Single-Center 2002-2018 Empirical/Pre-emptive Approach.,"Martino, R",32564177,2020,10.1007/s11046-020-00461-w,Mycopathologia,eng,Netherlands,Broad-spectrum antifungal prophylaxis is currently considered the standard of care for adults with de novo AML for the prevention of invasive fungal infections (IFIs)  especially invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Because fluconazole has been used in our center as anti-yeast prophylaxis  we sought to analyze in detail the incidence of IFIs over a 17-year period  as well as their impact on outcome. A standardized protocol of patient management  including serum galactomannan screening and thoracic CT-guided diagnostic-driven antifungal therapy  was used in all patients. A total of 214 consecutive adults with de novo AML who were treated in 3 CETLAM (Grupo Cooperativo para el Estudio y Tratamiento de las Leucemias Agudas y Mielodisplasias) protocols from 2002 to 2018 were included. The 90-day incidence of any IFI (including possible cases) was 11% (95% CI 4-15%)  most cases occurred during induction chemotherapy (8%  95% CI 4-12%)  and most cases were probable/proven IPA (8%  95% CI 3-13%). Developing an IFI during induction and consolidation had no impact on 1-year survival. A case-control study with 23 cases of IPA and 69 controls identified induction/re-induction chemotherapy  chronic pulmonary disease and age<U+2009>&gt;<U+2009>60 years/poor baseline performance status as potential pretreatment risk factors. The current study proves that inpatient induction and consolidation chemotherapy for de novo AML can be given in areas with &quot;a priori&quot; high-burden of airborne molds with fluconazole prophylaxis  while the selective use of anti-mold prophylaxis in patients at very high risk may further reduce the incidence of IFI in this specific clinical scenario.

We aimed to describe prognostic factors for influenza-associated IA (IAA) and poor outcome and mortality in critically ill patients in Switzerland. All adults with confirmed influenza admitted to the ICU at two Swiss tertiary care centres during the 2017/2018 influenza season were retrospectively evaluated. IAA was defined by clinical  mycological and radiological criteria: a positive galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage or histopathological or cultural evidence in respiratory specimens of Aspergillus spp.  any radiological infiltrate and a compatible clinical presentation. Poor outcome was defined as a composite of in-hospital mortality  ICU length of stay (LOS)  invasive ventilation for &gt; 7 days or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Of 81 patients with influenza in the ICU  9 (11%) were diagnosed with IAA. All patients with IAA had poor outcome compared to 26 (36%) patients without IAA (p &lt; 0.001). Median ICU-LOS and mortality were 17 vs. 3 days (p &lt; 0.01) and 3/9 (33%) vs. 13/72 (18%; p = 0.37) in patients with vs. without IAA  respectively. Patients with IAA had significantly longer durations of antibiotic therapy  vasoactive support and mechanical ventilation. Aspergillus was the most common respiratory co-pathogen (9/40  22%) followed by classical bacterial co-pathogens. IAA was not associated with classical risk factors. Aspergillus is a common superinfection in critically ill influenza patients associated with poor outcome and longer duration of organ supportive therapies. Given the absence of classical risk factors for aspergillosis  greater awareness is necessary  particularly in those requiring organ supportive therapies.

This study assessed the risk factors and outcomes of IPA after KT. A retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary-care referral hospital in Korea. Electronic medical records of patients diagnosed with IPA after KT between February 1995 and March 2015 were reviewed. The control patients comprised two patients who received KT before and after each IPA case. Twenty-six cases were diagnosed with IPA among 1963 recipients at a median of 58 years old. The most common cause of end-stage renal disease was diabetic nephropathy. The median time to diagnosis was 161 days. Delayed graft function was associated with the development of IPA. The overall 12-week mortality rate of IPA was 57.5%. Serum GM level<U+2009>=<U+2009>2 and BAL GM level<U+2009>=<U+2009>5 were associated with 12-week mortality in the Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Approximately half of IPA in KT recipients developed during the late posttransplant period (&gt;<U+2009>6 months)  especially after treatment for acute rejection. Careful monitoring for IPA is required in patients with delayed graft function  DM  and who received rejection therapy. Higher serum and BAL GM were associated with 12-week mortality.

We performed a retrospective multicenter cohort study. Data were collected from patients with avian influenza A (H7N9) infection admitted to 17 hospitals across China from February 2013 through February 2018. We found that IPA was diagnosed in 18 (5.4%) of 335 patients; 61.1% of patients with IPA (11 of 18) were identified before or within 2 days after an H7N9 virus-negative result. The median hospital stays in patients with or without IPA were 23.5 and 18 days  respectively (P &lt; .01)  and the median intensive care unit stays  respectively  were 22 and 12 days (P &lt; .01). Smoking in the past year and antibiotic use for &gt;7 days before admission were independently associated with IPA (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]  6.2 [1.7-26] for smoking and 4.89 [1.0-89] for antibiotic use). These findings provided important insights into the epidemiology and outcomes of IPA in patients with H7N9 infection in China.

15,76,76,Elena,NO,Treatment with etanercept and low monocyte concentration contribute to the risk of invasive aspergillosis in patients post allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,"Zoran, T",31754120,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-53504-8,Sci Rep,eng,England,Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening complication among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) recipients. Despite well known risk factors and different available assays  diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis remains challenging. 103 clinical variables from patients with hematological malignancies and subsequent alloSCT were collected. Associations between collected variables and patients with (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>36) and without IA (n<U+2009>=<U+2009>36) were investigated by applying univariate and multivariable logistic regression. The predictive power of the final model was tested in an independent patient cohort (23 IA cases and 25 control patients). Findings were investigated further by in vitro studies  which analysed the effect of etanercept on A. fumigatus-stimulated macrophages at the gene expression and cytokine secretion. Additionally  the release of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) in patient sera was studied. Low monocyte concentration (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.8<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-06)  severe GvHD of the gut (grade 2-4) (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.08<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-02) and etanercept treatment of GvHD (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>3.5<U+2009>×<U+2009>10-03) were significantly associated with IA. Our studies showed that etanercept lowers CXCL10 concentrations in vitro and ex vivo and down-regulates genes involved in immune responses and TNF-alpha signaling. Our study offers clinicians new information regarding risk factors for IA including low monocyte counts and administration of etanercept. After necessary validation  such information may be used for decision making regarding antifungal prophylaxis or closely monitoring patients at risk.
16,77,77,Elena,NO,Invasive Fungal Infections With Good Survival Following Liver Transplant: A Single-Center Experience From a Developing Country.,"Ebrahimi, A",31724926,2019,10.6002/ect.2019.0010,Exp Clin Transplant,eng,Turkey,"                 Label=""OBJECTIVES"":Invasive fungal infection following liver transplant is considered as one of the important factors influencing morbidity and mortality among liver transplant recipients. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of invasive fungal infections and their predisposing factors in a singlecenter cohort of patients who received liver transplant.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"":For this study  250 adult patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant between March 2010 and March 2015 were enrolled. All patients were followed prospectively for infections.                 Label=""RESULTS"":The diagnosis of invasive fungal infection was made in 15 patients (6%). One patient had 2 episodes of fungal infection  and reoperation was performed for 3 patients. Invasive aspergillosis developed in 8 patients (53.3%) followed by Candida species infection in 3 patients (20%) and cryptococcosis in 2 patients (13.3%).The main predisposing factors were renal failure (12/15) and positive history of rejection (11/15). Other risk factors for development of invasive fungal infections were choledochojejunostomy in 3 patients (20%)  bile leaks in 3 patients (20%)  and pretransplant steroid use in 2 patients (11.8%). Two patients (13.3%) died due to invasive fungal infections.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"":In this single-center series of liver transplant recipients  the incidence of invasive fungal infections was relatively low  probably due to the universal prophylaxis with fluconazole and limited use of the broad-spectrum antibiotics. Early diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections could lead to a better prognosis for liver transplant recipients with invasive fungal infections. "

In this population  Aspergillus spp. can have various clinical presentations including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA)  with high mortality (53-78%).                 Label=""OBJECTIVES"":To establish the characteristics of IPA infection in HT recipients and their outcomes in our center.                 Label=""METHODS"":Among 328 HTs performed in our center between 1998 and 2016  we identified five cases of IPA. Patient medical records were examined and clinical variables were extracted.                 Label=""RESULTS"":All cases were male  and mean age was 62 years. The most common indication for HT was non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Productive cough was reported as the main symptom. The radiological assessment was based on chest X-ray and chest computed tomography. The most commonly reported radiographic abnormality was multiple nodular opacities in both techniques. Bronchoscopy was performed in all patients and Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated in four cases on bronchoalveolar lavage culture. Treatment included amphotericin in four patients  subsequently changed to voriconazole in three  and posaconazole in one patient  with total treatment lasting an average of 12 months. Neutropenia was found in only one patient  renal failure was observed in two patients  and concurrent cytomegalovirus infection in three patients. All patients were alive after a mean follow-up of 18 months.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"":IPA is a potentially lethal complication after HT. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of aggressive treatment are the cornerstone of better survival. "
18,88,88,Elena,YES,Prevalence and outcome of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill patients with liver cirrhosis: an observational study.,"Lahmer, T",31417154,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-48183-4,Sci Rep,eng,England,Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is an important cause of morbidity/mortality in critically ill patients with endstage liver disease. Therefore  aim of this study is to predict the prevalence and outcome of IPA in critically ill patients with underlying liver cirrhosis and evaluation of the necessity Glactomannan (GM) screening in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in this cohort. In total 12 out of 84 patients (14%) had probable IPA. The mean optical density index (ODI) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) GM index was 3.6<U+2009>±<U+2009>1.5 (Range: 1.7-5.7). An overall sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 86-96%) and specificity of 85% (95% CI 81-88%) was found for the BAL GM in IPA. Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II)  sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) as well the model of endstage liver disease (MELD) score were significantly higher in the probable IPA group as compared to the No IPA group (26 versus 21  p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001 and 14 versus 10  p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.044). Length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was significantly longer in probable IPA patients (16 versus 10 days  p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.027) and mortality rate was significantly higher in probable IPA patients (100% versus 65%  p<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001) as compared to No IPA patients. APACHE II and MELD score were independently associated with higher mortality rate using multivariate logistic regression (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.025 and p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.034). In conclusion  IPA has a relevant impact on outcome. Screening for IPA is indicated  easy to perform and a necessity to improve outcome.

And  because of lack of unequivocal diagnostic criteria  a timely diagnosis remains challenging. We investigate the epidemiology of and the clinical risk factors for IA in critically ill patients. We conducted a retrospective  observational study of all consecutive ICU patients with evidence of IA in the postmortem examination. During the period of the study (25 years)  893 postmortem examinations were performed in the ICU. Twenty-five patients (2.8%) were diagnosed with IA in autopsy. Only ten (40%) were classified as IA ante-mortem  based on the initiation of antifungal treatment. The most common comorbid conditions were corticosteroid treatment (n = 14  56%)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 11  44%)  immunosuppression (n = 6  24%) and haematological malignancy (n = 5  20%). Twenty-three patients (92%) had three or more risk factors for IA. Critically ill patients with pulmonary infiltrates  treated with high doses intravenous corticosteroids (even for a short period of time)  particularly COPD patients who developed worsening respiratory insufficiency despite appropriate treatment were at the highest risk of IA.
20,99,99,Elena,YES,Genetic Polymorphisms Affecting IDO1 or IDO2 Activity Differently Associate With Aspergillosis in Humans.,"Napolioni, V",31134053,2019,10.3389/fimmu.2019.00890,Front Immunol,eng,Switzerland,Aspergillus is the causative agent of human diseases ranging from asthma to invasive infection. Genetic and environmental factors are crucial in regulating the interaction between the host and Aspergillus. The role played by the enzyme indoleamine 2 3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1)  which catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of tryptophan catabolism along the kynurenine pathway  is increasingly being recognized  but whether and how genetic variation of IDO1 influences the risk of aspergillosis in susceptible patients is incompletely understood. In addition  whether the closely related protein IDO2 plays a similar role remains unexplored. In the present study  we performed genetic association studies in two different cohorts of susceptible patients [cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)]  and identified IDO1 polymorphisms that associate with the risk of infection in both cohorts. By using human bronchial epithelial cells and PBMC from CF and HSCT patients  respectively  we could show that the IDO1 polymorphisms appeared to down-modulate IDO1 expression and function in response to IFN<U+03B3> or Aspergillus conidia  and to associate with an increased inflammatory response. In contrast  IDO2 polymorphisms  including variants known to profoundly affect protein expression and function  were differently associated with the risk of aspergillosis in the two cohorts of patients as no association was found in CF patients as opposed to recipients of HSCT. By resorting to a murine model of bone marrow transplantation  we could show that the absence of IDO2 more severely affected fungal burden and lung pathology upon infection with Aspergillus as compared to IDO1  and this effect appeared to be linked to a deficit in the antifungal effector phagocytic activity. Thus  our study confirms and extends the role of IDO1 in the response to Aspergillus  and shed light on the possible involvement of IDO2 in specific clinical settings.

Finally  the patients were classified as having putative aspergillosis or colonisation according to the criteria described previously.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":In total  986 cirrhotic patients were admitted to ICU during the study period. Among these  sixty patients had a positive Aspergillus sp. respiratory sample. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comorbidity and organ supports were significantly associated with Aspergillus colonisation. Seventeen patients (28%) were diagnosed as proven or putative IPA and 43 were considered as colonised by Aspergillus sp. The median delay between ICU admission and an IPA diagnosis was 2 [2-24] days. Only COPD was predictive of the presence of IPA (OR 6.44; 95% CI 1.43-28.92; p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0151) in patients with a positive Aspergillus sp. culture. The probability of in-hospital mortality was 71% in the IPA group versus 19% in the colonisation group (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.0001).                 Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":Patients with cirrhosis can be at risk of IPA  especially with COPD. Antifungal agents should be given as soon as possible mainly in cirrhotic patients with COPD. "

Number-needed-to-treat calculation indicates that  on average  71 patients should have received AP (instead of no AP) for one additional patient to not have IA. Initial antifungal therapy was 'pre-emptive' in 36 (64%) patients and 'targeted' in 20 (36%) patients. A good response to first-line therapy was observed in 26 (46%) patients  mainly those who received AP [16 of 22 (73%) versus 10 of 34 (29%); P<U+205F>=<U+205F>0.001].

Clinical risk factors for IA have not been fully characterized  especially in the era of extensive anti-fungal prophylaxis. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical risk factors associated with IA in LTRs. The secondary objective was to assess the mortality in LTRs who had at least 1 episode of IA compared with LTRs who never had experienced IA.                 Label=""METHODS"":We conducted an international  multicenter  retrospective cohort study of 900 consecutive adults who received lung transplants between 2005 and 2008 with 4years of follow-up.

Factors associated with the diagnosis of MMPIs were significant corticosteroid use [20 (74%) vs 6 (22%)  P &lt; 0.001]  sputum as the source specimen [13 (48%) vs 3 (11%)  P = 0.003]  younger age (median age: 58 vs 66 years  P = 0.006)  and male sex [22 (81%) vs 13 (48%)  P = 0.01]. Haematological cancers other than acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were less common in MMPIs than in IPA patients [AML/MDS: 6 (22%) vs 14 (52%)  P = 0.04]. Only significant corticosteroid use [95% CI (2.7-42.7)  P &lt; 0.001]  and sputum as the source specimen [95% (1.6-41.6)  P = 0.012] were statistically significant as independently associated with increased risk of MMPIs diagnosis in multivariate analysis. Total mortality rate at day 42 postdiagnosis was comparable in both groups.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical  radiological and demographic characteristics and treatment responses of patients with IPA after MWA.                 Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"":From January 2011 to January 2016  all patients who were treated by MWA of their lung tumors from six health institutions were enrolled in this study. Patients with IPA secondary to MWA were identified and retrospectively evaluated for predisposing factors  clinical treatment  and outcome.                 Label=""RESULTS"":The incidence of IPA secondary to lung MWA was 1.44% (23/1596). Of the 23 patients who developed IPA  six died as a consequence  resulting in a high mortality rate of 26.1%. Using computed tomography (CT)  pulmonary cavitation was the most common finding and occurred in 87.0% (20/23) of the patients. Sudden massive hemoptysis was responsible for one-third of the deaths (2/6). Most patients (22/23) received voriconazole as an initial treatment  and six patients with huge cavities underwent intracavitary lavage. Finally  17 patients (73.9%) achieved treatment success.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"":Lung MWA may be an additional host risk factor for IPA  particularly in elderly patients with underlying diseases and in patients who have recently undergone chemotherapy. Early and accurate diagnosis of IPA after MWA is critical for patient prognosis. Voriconazole should be given as the first-line treatment as early as possible. Bronchial artery embolization or intracavitary lavage may be required in some patients. "

A retrospective evaluation was performed of patients receiving vv-ECMO at a tertiary hospital in Manchester (UK) between January 2012 and December 2016. Data collected included epidemiological data  microbiological cultures  radiographic findings and outcomes. Cases were classified as proven IPA  putative IPA or Aspergillus colonisation according to a validated clinical algorithm. One hundred thirty-four patients were supported with vv-ECMO  median age of 45.5 years (range 16.4-73.4). Ten (7%) patients had putative IPA and nine (7%) had Aspergillus colonisation. Half of the patients with putative IPA lacked classical host risk factors for IPA. The median number of days on ECMO prior to Aspergillus isolation was 5 days. Immunosuppression and influenza A infection were significantly associated with developing IPA in a logistic regression model. Cox regression model demonstrates a three times greater hazard of death associated with IPA. Overall 6-month mortality rate was 38%. Patients with putative IPA and colonised patients had a 6-month mortality rate of 80 and 11%  respectively. Immunosuppression and influenza A infection are independent risk factors for IPA. IPA  but not Aspergillus colonisation  is associated with high long-term mortality in patients supported with vv-ECMO.

The possible risk factors  clinical presentation  and treatment of patients with simultaneous liver failure and IPA have received little attention in previous studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of IPA in patients with liver failure in an effort to reduce patient mortality. Methods The patients with liver failure (including acute liver failure   sub-acute liver failure   acute-on-chronic liver failure and chronic liver failure) were recruited from 2011 to 2016. The clinical data of these patients were retrieved for the study. Results In total  1077 patients with liver failure were included in this study. Of the 1077 patients  53 (4.9%) had IPA. Forty-four (83%) patients with IPA died. Independent risk factors for IPA were male sex (hazard ratio [HR]<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.542)  hepatorenal syndrome (HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.463)  antibiotic use (HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>4.631)  and steroid exposure (HR<U+2009>=<U+2009>18.615). Conclusions IPA is a fatal complication in patients with liver failure. Male sex  hepatorenal syndrome  antibiotic use  and steroid exposure were independent risk factors for IPA. When patients with liver failure have these risk factors and symptoms of pneumonia such as cough or hemoptysis  clinicians should be cautious about the possibility of IPA.

The incidence of IA in high-risk hematology populations is relatively low (&lt;10%)  despite unavoidable Aspergillus exposure in patients with a potentially similar clinical risk. Nonclinical variables  including genetic mutations that increase susceptibility to IA  could explain why only certain patients develop the disease. This study screened for mutations in 322 hematology patients classified according to IA status and developed a predictive model based on genetic risk  established clinical risk factors  and diagnostic biomarkers. Genetic markers were determined by real-time PCR and  with clinical risk factors and Aspergillus PCR results  subjected to multilogistic regression analysis to identify a best-fit model for predicting IA. The probability of IA was calculated  and an optimal threshold was determined. Mutations in dectin-1 (rs7309123) and DC-SIGN (rs11465384 and rs7248637)  allogeneic stem cell transplantation  respiratory virus infection  and Aspergillus PCR positivity were all significant risk factors for developing IA and were combined in a predictive model. An optimal threshold requiring three positive factors generated a mean sensitivity/specificity of 70.4%/89.2% and a probability of developing IA of 56.7%. In patients with no risk factors  the probability of developing IA was 2.4%  compared to &gt;79.1% in patients with four or more factors. Using a risk threshold of 50%  preemptive therapy would have been prescribed for 8.4% of the population. This pilot study shows that patients can be stratified according to risk of IA  providing personalized medicine based on strategic evidence for the management of IA. Further studies are required to confirm this approach.

We included in this multinational retrospective study 112 recipients diagnosed with probable (75.0% of cases) or proven (25.0%) IPA between 2000 and 2013. The median interval from transplantation to diagnosis was 230 days. Cough  fever  and expectoration were the most common symptoms at presentation. Bilateral pulmonary involvement was observed in 63.6% of cases. Positivity rates for the galactomannan assay in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were 61.3% and 57.1%  respectively. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most commonly identified species. Six- and 12-week survival rates were 68.8% and 60.7%  respectively  and 22.1% of survivors experienced graft loss. Occurrence of IPA within the first 6 months (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.29; p-value = 0.027) and bilateral involvement at diagnosis (HR: 3.00; p-value = 0.017) were independent predictors for 6-week all-cause mortality  whereas the initial use of a voriconazole-based regimen showed a protective effect (HR: 0.34; p-value = 0.007). The administration of antifungal combination therapy had no apparent impact on outcome. In conclusion  IPA entails a dismal prognosis among KT recipients. Maintaining a low clinical suspicion threshold is key to achieve a prompt diagnosis and to initiate voriconazole therapy.

We performed a multinational case-control study that included 51 kidney transplant (KT) recipients diagnosed with early (first 180 posttransplant days) IPA at 19 institutions between 2000 and 2013. Control recipients were matched (1:1 ratio) by center and date of transplantation. Overall mortality among cases was 60.8%  and 25.0% of living recipients experienced graft loss. Pretransplant diagnosis of chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD; odds ratio [OR]: 9.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-90.58; p = 0.041) and delayed graft function (OR: 3.40; 95% CI: 1.08-10.73; p = 0.037) were identified as independent risk factors for IPA among those variables already available in the immediate peritransplant period. The development of bloodstream infection (OR: 18.76; 95% CI: 1.04-339.37; p = 0.047) and acute graft rejection (OR: 40.73  95% CI: 3.63-456.98; p = 0.003) within the 3 mo prior to the diagnosis of IPA acted as risk factors during the subsequent period. In conclusion  pretransplant COPD  impaired graft function and the occurrence of serious posttransplant infections may be useful to identify KT recipients at the highest risk of early IPA. Future studies should explore the potential benefit of antimold prophylaxis in this group.

Targeted antifungal prophylaxis is recommended for high-risk populations; however  the epidemiology of IFI has changed  and the risk criteria remain unclear. In addition  the risk factors for late-onset invasive aspergillosis (IA) have not been fully characterized. We examined 279 recipients over 16 years of age to uncover their IFI epidemiology  clinical characteristics and outcomes. In addition  a case-control study was performed to identify the risk factors of late-onset IA. Of the 279 recipients  96.1% underwent living donor liver transplantation. Antifungal prophylaxis was administered to 80.6% of the recipients. IFI occurred in 15 patients  among which 8 cases were early-onset (=90 days after liver transplantation) and 7 cases were late-onset (&gt;90 days after liver transplantation). Five of the late-onset cases were invasive pulmonary aspergillosis  and 2 were fungemia cases. The mortality rate of late-onset IA was 80.0%. According to a multivariate analysis  steroid use before liver transplantation  bloodstream infection within 90 days after liver transplantation and reoperation within 90 days after liver transplantation were significant risk factors for late-onset IA after liver transplantation. The prevalence of IFI was low in our population given that over 80% of liver recipients received antifungal prophylaxis. The prognosis of late-onset IA remains poor  and predictors associated with late-onset IA  such as steroid use before liver transplantation  bloodstream infection and reoperation after liver transplantation  may help clinicians to optimize prevention measures for these devastating infections.

Recently  several studies have indicated a high incidence of IA in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However  few data are available on the epidemiology and outcome of patients with IA in this setting.                 Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"":An observational study including all patients with a positive Aspergillus culture during ICU stay was performed in 30 ICUs in 8 countries. Cases were classified as proven IA  putative IA or Aspergillus colonization according to recently validated criteria. Demographic  microbiologic and diagnostic data were collected. Outcome was recorded 12 weeks after Aspergillus isolation.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":A total of 563 patients were included  of whom 266 were colonized (47%)  203 had putative IA (36%) and 94 had proven IA (17%). The lung was the most frequent site of infection (94%)  and Aspergillus fumigatus the most commonly isolated species (92%). Patients with IA had higher incidences of cancer and organ transplantation than those with colonization. Compared with other patients  they were more frequently diagnosed with sepsis on ICU admission and more frequently received vasopressors and renal replacement therapy (RRT) during the ICU stay. Mortality was 38% among colonized patients  67% in those with putative IA and 79% in those with proven IA (P<U+2009>&lt;<U+2009>0.001). Independent risk factors for death among patients with IA included older age  history of bone marrow transplantation  and mechanical ventilation  RRT and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at diagnosis.                 Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"":IA among critically ill patients is associated with high mortality. Patients diagnosed with proven or putative IA had greater severity of illness and more frequently needed organ support than those with Aspergillus spp colonization. "

The 2-year survival of patients having had remission of AML was 54% and  for patients with failure of chemotherapy  it was 5% (p &lt; 0.001). The 2-year survival of patients having had IA was 14%  and without IA  it was 32% (p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that IA was associated with a higher risk of death in case of remission compared to no IA (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.66 [1.05-2.65]  p = 0.031) and also in case of failure (HR = 6.43  p &lt; 0.001). IA was associated with an increased risk of death for patients if they were either in remission or in failure after induction chemotherapy.

Admissions per hospital and transplantation procedures were obtained. Cox regression models were used to determine risk factors associated with the 12-week overall mortality. With 424 case-patients included  the median incidence/hospital was 0.271/10(3) admissions (range 0.072-0.910) without significant alteration of incidence and seasonality over time. Among the 393 adults (62% men  56 years (16-84 years))  15% had proven IA  78% haematological conditions  and 92.9% had lung involvement. Acute leukaemia (34.6%) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (21.4%) were major host factors  together with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (21.6%)  which emerged as a new high-risk group. The other risk host factors consisted of solid organ transplantation (8.7%)  solid tumours (4.3%)  systemic inflammatory diseases (4.6%) and chronic respiratory diseases (2.3%). Serum galactomannan tests were more often positive (=69%) for acute leukaemia and allogeneic stem cell transplantation than for the others (&lt;42%; p &lt;10(-3)). When positive (n = 245)  cultures mainly yielded Aspergillus fumigatus (79.7%). First-line antifungal therapy consisted of voriconazole  caspofungin  lipid formulations of amphotericin  or any combination therapy (52%  14%  8% and 19.9%  respectively). Twelve-week overall mortality was 44.8% (95% CI  39.8-50.0); it was 41% when first-line therapy included voriconazole and 60% otherwise (p &lt;0.001). Independent factors for 12-week mortality were older age  positivity for both culture and galactomannan and central nervous system or pleural involvement  while any strategy containing voriconazole was protective.

To investigate the immediate and mid-term benefits of posaconazole prophylaxis in AML patients undergoing first induction chemotherapy and to study the infection risk factors  we prospectively studied the IA incidence in these patients at our hospital between years 2007 and 2008; then we compared them to a matched control group without prophylaxis. There were 55 and 66 patients in each group respectively. At day 32 post-induction  two probable cases (3.6%) were scored in the prophylaxis group compared to 8 cases (12.1%) in the control group (4 possible and 4 probable). At day 100  it reached 7.27% and 15.5% respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis at day 100 showed lower mortality rate in the prophylaxis group compared to the control group [3.64% (n = 2  none due to IA) and 10.61% (n = 7  four due to IA) respectively  P = 0.002]. Multivariate analysis showed age and lack of response to induction as independent infection risk factors. Posaconazole prophylaxis resulted in lower incidence of IA and significantly improved survival. Patient's age and response to induction treatment are two independent infection risk factors  and need more attention during future clinical trials linked to antifungal prophylaxis.

A total of 43 patients with probable IPA were selected as the case group  another 43 patients with bacterial infection and 43 patients without any infections were selected  for whose age  sex  date of admission  and the disease onset were matched with the case group. We evaluated the risk factors  clinical manifestations  treatment  and subsequent outcome of IPA in patients with HBV-related liver failure. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to demonstrate risk factors associated with IPA. Compared with patients with bacterial infection and those without any infection  patients with probable IPA used more antibiotics and steroids  and had poorer conditions and the highest mortality (P &lt; 0.0001). Multiple antibiotics use and frequent invasive procedures were independent factors associated with the occurrence of IPA in patients with HBV-related liver failure. Patients with HBV-related liver failure are predisposed to IPA and may have a more severe condition and poorer prognosis.

Case identification was based on a comprehensive screening of hospital records. All cases of proven and probable IA were retrospectively analysed. Sixty-seven patients were analysed (median age 60 years; 76% male). Sixty-three per cent of cases were invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA)  and 17% of these were disseminated aspergillosis. The incidence of IPA was 1.2/10 000 admissions. Six of ten cases of extrapulmonary IA affected the brain. There were six cases of invasive rhinosinusitis  six cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis  and cases three of subacute pulmonary aspergillosis. The most frequent underlying condition of IA was corticosteroid treatment (57%)  followed by chronic lung disease (48%)  and intensive-care unit stays (43%). In 38% of patients with IPA  the diagnosis was established at autopsy. Old age was the only risk factor for post-mortem diagnosis  whereas previous solid organ transplantation and chronic lung disease were associated with lower odds of post-mortem diagnosis.

All 306 patients who underwent alternative donor HSCT between 01 January 1999 and 31 December 2006 were studied. Late IA was defined as occurring &gt;or=40 days after HSCT. The median follow-up was 284 days (range  1-2709). Donors were matched unrelated (n=185)  mismatched related (n=69)  mismatched unrelated (n=35) and unrelated cord blood (n=17). According to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria  2 patients already had IA at HSCT  23 had early IA and 20 had late IA (IA incidence 15%). Eight patients had proven and 37 probable IA. Multivariate analyses showed that significant predictors of IA were delayed neutrophil engraftment  extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD)  secondary neutropenia and relapse after transplant. Early IA was associated with active malignancy at HSCT  CMV reactivation and delayed lymphocyte engraftment. Late IA was predicted by cGVHD  steroid therapy  secondary neutropenia and relapse after HSCT. IA-related mortality among IA patients was 67% and was influenced by use of anti-thymocyte globulin  steroids  higher levels of creatinine  and lower levels of IgA and platelets. The outcome of IA depends on the severity of immunodeficiency and the status of the underlying disease.

In contrast to conventional HSCT  few investigators have examined risk factors of IA associated with nonmyeloablative (NMA) regimens characterized by outpatient administration  immunosuppression rather than cytoreduction  and short duration of neutropenia posttransplant. We report our results on a cohort of 125 patients treated homogenously who received a 6/6 matched sibling NMA HSCT designed to be performed on an outpatient basis. Conditioning regimen included fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) x 5 days) and cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m(2) x 5 days) followed by reinfusion of a minimum of 4 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Overall  13 patients developed IA (5 proved  6 probable  2 possible) 44-791 days (median 229) after NMA HSCT  with a risk of 7% at 1  11% at 2  and 15% at 3 years. Patients who suffered from IA had poorer overall survival (crude hazard ratio 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-5.4; P = .045). Intestinal aGVHD or chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was significantly associated with IA at 1 (27% versus 3%  P = .003)  2 (27% versus 8%  P = .01)  and 3 years (37% versus 10%  P = .005). The use of daclizumab was also significantly associated with IA at 3 years (47% versus 12%  P = .02). Age  sex  diagnosis  previous autologous transplant  duration of neutropenia  occurrence of cytomegalovirus viremia  duration of steroids or MMF intake  aGVHD  cGVHD  and cumulative number of days spent in hospital were not associated with IA. After multivariate analysis  intestinal GVHD remained the only statistically significant risk factor for IA at 1 (P = .003)  2 (P = .01)  and 3 years (P = .005). We conclude that in NMA HSCT  the risk of IA increases over time and is significantly associated with intestinal GVHD. Because there is currently no surrogate in vitro markers of immunocompetence following NMA HSCT  this clinical finding is of particular importance to identify a population at higher risk who should be targeted for antimold prophylaxis.

Invasive aspergillosis was associated with 58% mortality after 2 years  whereas colonisation was not associated with early increased mortality but was associated with increased mortality after 5 years compared to non-infected patients (P &lt; 0.05). An analysis of demographic factors showed that donor age [OR 1.40 per decade (95% CI 1.10-1.80)]  ischaemia time [OR 1.17 per hour increase (95% CI 1.01-1.39)]  and use of daclizumab versus polyclonal induction [OR 2.05 (95% CI 1.14-3.75)] were independent risk factors for Aspergillus infection. Invasive aspergillosis was associated with early and high mortality in lung transplant patients. Colonisation with Aspergillus was also associated with a significant increase in mortality after 5 years. CF patients have a higher incidence of Aspergillus infection than non-CF patients.

Risk factors for IA after deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) have been presented in several reports  but are not well established for living donor liver transplant recipients. Here  a retrospective case-control study was performed. Five cases with IA were investigated after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) between January 1999 and December 2002 at Kyoto University Hospital. For comparison  living donor liver transplant recipients without IA were taken as controls. These patients had undergone LDLT 1 month before or after each IA case and had the same survival times as the latter. We evaluated the clinical and laboratory findings for both groups up until their demise. Patients with IA after LDLT had a very poor prognosis. By univariate analysis  risk factors for IA were preoperative intensive care unit stay (P = 0.02) and preoperative steroid administration (P = 0.02). Preoperative steroid administration for fulminant hepatitis possibly predisposed to the development of IA after LDLT.

Risk factors  antifungal use and duration of therapy were noted.                 Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"":Out of a total of 1756 patients  Aspergillus spp. were recovered in 36. Treatment with steroids (odds ratio = 4.5) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (odds ratio = 2.9) were significantly associated with Aspergillus spp. isolation in multivariate analysis. In 14 patients isolation of Aspergillus spp. was interpreted as colonization  in 20 it was interpreted as invasive aspergillosis  and two cases were not classified. The mortality rates were 50% in the colonization group and 80% in the invasive infection group. Autopsy was performed in five patients with clinically suspected infection and confirmed the diagnosis in all of these cases.

74,691,691,Elena,NO,Aspergillus infections in lung transplant recipients: risk factors and outcome.,"Solé, A",15819861,2005,10.1111/j.1469-0691.2005.01128.x,Clin Microbiol Infect,eng,England,This retrospective study of 251 lung transplant patients aimed to determine the prevalence  clinical presentation and mortality of Aspergillus infection in order to define specific risk factors and to compare survival in patients with and without infection. Aspergillus was isolated from 86 (33%) cases  which involved colonisation (n = 50)  tracheobronchial lesions (n = 17) or invasive aspergillosis (n = 19). Overall  aspergillosis had an impact on survival (p &lt; 0.05); in fact the 5-year mortality rate was substantially higher in single lung transplant recipients with bronchial anastomotic infection  and in those with late-onset infections and chronic rejection. A significant association (p &lt; 0.05) was found between acute rejection and the time at which fungal infection was diagnosed. Aspergillus infection was not related to cytomegalovirus infection or treatment with corticosteroids. The mortality rate for invasive infections was 78% and was related to survival (p &lt; 0.0001); invasive aspergillosis was also associated with chronic rejection (p &lt; 0.05)  but not with high corticosteroid doses (p 0.49) or use of tacrolimus (p 0.73). In conclusion  Aspergillus infection was associated with a reduction in the 5-year survival rate of lung transplant recipients  and this was particularly true for patients infected with the invasive forms and for patients with single lung transplants  bronchial anastomotic infection and chronic rejection. Isolation of Aspergillus spp. from respiratory samples preceded acute rejection  and may be a marker of graft dysfunction and/or airway inflammation. Close monitoring  or even pre-emptive antifungal therapy  is recommended for patients with chronic rejection or bronchial airway mechanical abnormalities and persistent Aspergillus colonisation.

76,705,705,Elena,NO,Invasive aspergillosis in critically ill patients without malignancy.,"Meersseman, W",15229094,2004,10.1164/rccm.200401-093OC,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,eng,United States,Using criteria designed for invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with cancer  we aimed to determine the impact of IA in patients without malignancy in a medical intensive care unit (ICU). In this retrospective study  127 patients out of 1 850 admissions (6.9%) hospitalized between 2000 and 2003 had microbiological or histopathologic evidence of Aspergillus during their ICU stay. There were 89 cases (70%) without hematologic malignancy. These patients were classified as proven IA (n = 30)  probable IA (n = 37)  possible IA (n = 2)  or colonization (n = 20). In these patients  mean SAPS II score was 52 with a predicted mortality of 48%. The observed mortality was 80% (n = 71). Mortality of the proven and the probable IA was 97 and 87%  respectively. Postmortem examination was done in 46 out of 71 patients  and 27 autopsies (59%) showed hyphael invasion with Aspergillus. Aspergillus infections occurred in five critically ill patients with proven IA who did not have any predisposing factors according to the currently available definitions. Three of these patients had Child C liver cirrhosis. IA is an emerging and devastating infectious disease in patients in the ICU without malignancy. In those patients  host criteria for probable fungal infections should probably be adapted.
77,706,706,Elena,contact,Invasive aspergillosis before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: 10-year experience at a single transplant center.,"Fukuda, T",15205670,2004,10.1016/j.bbmt.2004.02.006,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,eng,United States,Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with prior or active invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a frequent consideration. We reviewed outcomes of 2319 patients who underwent transplantation between 1992 and 2001 in our institution  among whom 45 patients (1.9%) had a known history of IA before HCT. Posttransplantation IA occurred in 13 of these 45 patients with a pretransplantation history (29%). Nine infections were considered recurrent by anatomic site and timing. Compared with all other patients who received allogeneic HCT during the same period  patients with histories of IA had lower overall survival (56% versus 77%; P =.0001) and higher transplant-related mortality (TRM; 38% versus 21%; P =.0001) 100 days after HCT  associated mainly with IA and other pulmonary complications. Among patients with prior IA  posttransplantation IA occurred more frequently in patients who received &lt;1 month of antifungal therapy before HCT (4/6 versus 6/39; P =.001). The probability of posttransplantation IA and overall survival among patients who received &gt;1 month of antifungal therapy and had resolution of radiographic abnormalities were not different from those of patients without prior IA. Patients with prior IA who received conditioning with total body irradiation (TBI) had higher TRM compared with those who received nonmyeloablative and non-total body irradiation-based regimens (16/31 versus 2/14; P =.024). Thus  the duration of antifungal therapy before transplantation  the resolution of radiographic abnormalities  and conditioning regimens are important variables to consider for minimizing the risk for IA recurrence and TRM after allogeneic HCT.
78,708,708,Elena,contact,Risk factors for post-engraftment invasive aspergillosis in allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,"Thursky, K",15156166,2004,10.1038/sj.bmt.1704543,Bone Marrow Transplant,eng,England,The majority of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) occurs during the post-engraftment period. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate post-engraftment IA risk in a cohort of 217 allogeneic SCT recipients from 1991 to 1998. The aim was to quantify the effects of dose-intensity and duration of corticosteroids and other risk factors. Median duration of follow-up was 330 days. There were 19 cases of IA (overall 8.8%) with 14 post-engraftment infections. In the final model  the risk of IA was greatest within 2 weeks of high-dose corticosteroids (HR 8.5  P=0.003)  with risk extending to 4 weeks with doses of 0.25-1 mg/kg/day (HR 3.1  P=0.08). Ganciclovir was associated with greatest risk (HR 13.6). Grade 3 or 4 acute GVHD (HR 5.7) and secondary neutropenia (HR=1.3) were also additive risks. In the univariate analysis  corticosteroid doses of 0.25-1.0 mg/kg/day for any duration between 2 and 10 weeks demonstrated prolonged risk for IA. Moderate doses of corticosteroids can confer an increased risk for IA for extended periods which is almost as marked as that conferred by higher doses. Knowledge of these risks may facilitate the development of targeted surveillance and prophylaxis strategies for prevention of IA.
79,710,710,Elena,YES,Risk factors of invasive aspergillosis after heart transplantation: protective role of oral itraconazole prophylaxis.,"Muñoz, P",15023157,2004,10.1111/j.1600-6143.2004.00390.x,Am J Transplant,eng,United States,The study was designed to identify a subset of heart transplant (HT) recipients who could benefit from the administration of targeted antifungal prophylaxis and to evaluate the efficacy of oral itraconazole as the preventive drug. We have analyzed the risk factors for invasive aspergillosis (IA) in our entire population of HT recipients (1988-2002) and also the role of oral itraconazole prophylaxis that was provided to all patients since 1995 [400 mg q.d. of itraconazole oral (PO) for 3-6 months]. There were 24 cases of IA. Our main results indicate that the independent risk factors for IA after heart transplantation are: re-operation (RR 5.8; 95% CI 1.8-18  p=0.002)  cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease (RR 5.2; 95% CI 2-13.9  p=0.001)  post-transplant hemodialysis (RR 4.9; 95% CI 1.2-18  p=0.02)  and the existence of an episode of IA in the HT program 2 months before or after the transplantation date (RR 4.6; 95% CI 1.5-14.4  p=0.007). Itraconazole prophylaxis showed an independent protective value against developing IA (RR 0.2; 95% CI 0.07-0.9  p=0.03) and also determined a significantly prolonged 1-year survival (RR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.8  p=0.01). We believe that antifungal prophylaxis in heart transplant patients should be offered at least to patients with one or more of these predisposing conditions.

The median time of onset from transplantation for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) was 46 days  but the median time to first positive culture result was 104 days among patients with Aspergillus colonization but no invasive disease. Most patients with IPA presented with fever and cough within the first 90 days of transplantation and with single or multiple pulmonary nodules. None of the heart transplant recipients with either IPA or invasive extrapulmonary aspergillosis (IEPA) had associated neutropenia. Human leukocyte antigen A1 locus was found significantly more frequently among patients colonized with Aspergillus than among patients with IPA (P&lt;.006) or IEPA (P&lt;.001). Even in the absence of neutropenia  IPA should be suspected for heart transplant recipients who have fever and respiratory symptoms within the first 3 months of transplantation  have a positive result of culture of respiratory secretions  and have abnormal radiological findings (particularly nodules).
81,736,736,Elena,NO,Risk factors for invasive aspergillosis in liver transplant recipients.,"Fortún, J",12424722,2002,10.1053/jlts.2002.36239,Liver Transpl,eng,United States,Aspergillosis is a potential  severe  and usually early complication of liver transplantation. New promising strategies  such as detecting Aspergillus antigenemia  have been used for the diagnosis of aspergillosis in immunosuppressed patients  but the impact in solid organ transplantation is not well known. A case-control study in 260 adults who underwent liver transplantation from January 1994 to June 2000 was performed. A case was defined as any liver transplant recipient with a proven or probable diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Controls were defined as a liver transplant recipient without aspergillosis infection with a survival longer than two months after transplantation. Clinical and analytical variables  including Aspergillus antigenemia  were compared. A special analysis was performed in patients in whom late aspergillosis developed (after day 100 posttransplantation). Among 260 patients  invasive aspergillosis developed in 15 (5.6%). Median time from transplantation to aspergillosis in 13 patients with sufficient data for analysis was 126 days (range  22 to 1117). Seven (54%) developed the infection after day 100 posttransplantation. Thirty-eight patients were used as controls. Antigenemia was available in nine of 13 cases and in 33 of 38 controls. By multivariate analysis  retransplantation (OR  29.9 [95% CI  2.1 to 425.1])  dialysis requirements after transplantation (OR  24.5 [95% CI  1.25 to 354])  and the presence of Aspergillus antigenemia in serum at any time point after transplantation (OR  50.0 [95% CI  3.56 to 650]) were independently associated to aspergillosis. In the subgroup of patients that developed late aspergillosis  cytomegalovirus infection (OR  6.7 [95% CI  1.0 to 42.5]) was the only independent factor associated. Hepatic and renal dysfunction predispose to Aspergillus infection in liver transplant recipients. Cytomegalovirus infection and increased immunosuppression favor invasive aspergillosis during the late posttransplantation period. Aspergillus antigenemia seems to be a good predictor of invasive aspergillosis.

We determined risks for IA and outcomes among 1682 patients who received HSCTs between January 1993 and December 1998. Risk factors included host variables (age  underlying disease)  transplant variables (stem cell source)  and late complications (acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease [GVHD]  receipt of corticosteroids  secondary neutropenia  cytomegalovirus [CMV] disease  and respiratory virus infection). We identified risk factors associated with IA early after transplantation (&lt;or= 40 days) and after engraftment (41-180 days). Older patient age was associated with an increased risk during both periods. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase was associated with low risk for early IA compared with other hematologic malignancies  aplastic anemia  and myelodysplastic syndrome. Multiple myeloma was associated with an increased risk for postengraftment IA. Use of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related (MR) peripheral blood stem cells conferred protection against early IA compared with use of MR bone marrow  but use of cord blood increased the risk of IA early after transplantation. Factors that increased risks for IA after engraftment included receipt of T cell-depleted or CD34-selected stem cell products  receipt of corticosteroids  neutropenia  lymphopenia  GVHD  CMV disease  and respiratory virus infections. Very late IA (&gt; 6 months after transplantation) was associated with chronic GVHD and CMV disease. These results emphasize the postengraftment timing of IA; risk factor analyses verify previously recognized risk factors (GVHD  receipt of corticosteroids  and neutropenia) and uncover the roles of lymphopenia and viral infections in increasing the incidence of postengraftment IA in the 1990s.

To assess the incidence of IA following lung transplantation and to identify risk factors for its occurrence  we performed a case-control study involving 101 patients undergoing lung transplantation at our institution from 1990 to 1995 and reviewed the findings. Fourteen patients (14%) developed IA. The mean time from transplantation to diagnosis was 15 months. Nine patients died; the mean time to death from diagnosis was 13 days. Risk factors associated with developing IA included concomitant cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia or viremia and culture isolation of Aspergillus species from a respiratory tract specimen after lung transplantation. Optimal strategies to prevent IA in lung transplant recipients remain to be determined  but prevention of aspergillus airway colonization and CMV viremia and disease after transplantation may be important targets for prophylactic interventions.
84,822,822,Elena,YES,Epidemiology of Aspergillus infections in a large cohort of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.,"Wald, A",9180187,1997,10.1086/516480,J Infect Dis,eng,United States,To investigate the incidence  risk factors  and outcome of Aspergillus infections among marrow transplant recipients  records from 2496 patients were reviewed  and 214 patients had Aspergillus organisms identified. Of these  158 had invasive aspergillosis  44 were colonized  and 12 had contaminated cultures. The incidence of invasive aspergillosis increased from 5.7% to 11.2% during the study. The onset of infection was bimodal  peaking 16 and 96 days after transplant. For patients within 40 days after transplant  underlying disease  donor type  season  and transplant outside of laminar air flow rooms were associated with significant risk for invasive aspergillosis. For patients &gt;40 days after transplant  age  underlying disease  donor type  graft-versus-host disease  neutropenia  and corticosteroid use were associated with increased risk of aspergillosis. Only 31% of infected patients were neutropenic at the time of diagnosis. The risk factors for aspergillosis depend on the time after marrow transplant and include both host and environmental characteristics.
